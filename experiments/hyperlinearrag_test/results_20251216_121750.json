      "Mechanism of action of some bitter-tasting compounds on frog taste cells. Effects of some bitter-tasting compounds on frog taste receptors were examined by recording glossopharyngeal nerve responses. The order of effectiveness of the compounds was quinine greater than brucine greater than formanilide greater than caffeine greater than urea. When the effects of quinine, brucine and caffeine on electrical responses in taste cells were examined, they all produced a depolarization associated with an increased input resistance. The action of the three compounds on taste receptors therefore, operates with a similar mechanism. The electrical responses in cells, produced by quinine, progressed slowly with time. Such effects with quinine are similar to those with procaine. After adaptation to quinine, the nerve responses to various chemical stimuli were gradually reduced in magnitude, while the electrical responses in taste cells during stimulation by chemicals became smaller. The mechanism of the effects of bitter stimuli are discussed in light of recent findings on the interaction of bitter stimuli with lipid monolayers and the extraction of lipid from bovine taste papillae by bitter stimuli."

      "Paragangliomatosis associated with multiple endocrine adenomas. A 19-year-old woman had multiple functioning extra-adrenal paragangliomas, a pituitary adenoma associated with acromegaly, parathyroid hyperplasia, and pigmentary abnormalities. This case differs from previously described instances of multiple endocrine adenomatosis (MEA) and has features that bridge the classic MEA type 1 and 2 syndromes and possibly Von Recklinghausen disease. The coexistence of pheochromocytoma with acromegaly is extremely rare, and the association with extra-adrenal paragangiliomas appears to be unique. Thyroid parafollicular cell proliferation could not be proved by immunohistochemical or electron microscopical studies. The large number and extensive distribution of paragangliomas, ranging from neck to pelvis, is another unique feature of this case. The concept of neurocrestopathy or of an endocrine polypeptide (APUD) cell system may offer an explanation for the interrelation of these diverse growths.",

The sites of ischaemic injury within the kidney are reviewed and the diagnostic value of measurements of plasma and urinary enzymes in renal ischaemic injury and in renal homotransplant rejection in experimental animals and man is examined. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) is an enzyme primarily located in the brush border of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney. Its unique localization in the cells most easily damaged by ischaemia and its ease of assay provide the rationale for its use in the measurement and diagnosis of renal ischaemic injury. gamma-GT activity was measured in dogs undergoing varying periods of renal ischaemia and under conditions of local renal hypothermia and was shown to be a sensitive indicator of ischaemic injury.

      "The ultrastructure of the human epidermis in chronic graft-versus-host disease. The epidermal ultrastructure of 11 allogeneic bone marrow recipients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was compared with that of 4 recipients without chronic GVHD. This electron microscope study revealed three patterns of epidermal injury typical of chronic GVHD. The first type was a nonacantholytic (nondissecting) injury with a prominent cellular infiltrate consisting primarily of lymphocytes accompanied by a few macrophages. The second type was an acantholytic (dissecting) injury with a prominent infiltrate, while the third was a nondissecting injury with a sparse infiltrate. Broad-zone contact was observed between lymphocytes and all epidermal cell types as well as between other lymphocytes and macrophages. Point contact was only observed between lymphocytes and epidermal cells. Lymphocytes appeared to detach desmosomes from adjacent keratinocytes by isolating them with cytoplasmic projections, a phenomenon not previously described. Typical damage to the epidermal cells in the basal and spinous layers consisted of either swelling of the organelles or condensation of the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the keratinocyte, the condensation reaction resulted in the formation of colloid bodies, some of which were phagocytized by macrophages. Besides the cytolytic events, a concurrent stimulatory reaction occurred in the epidermal cells. The number of melanosomes in melanocytes and of Langerhans cell granules and dense bodies in the Langerhans cells all increased. Extensive areas of replication and disruption of the basal lamina were subjacent to areas of necrosis in the basal layer.",

      "Nephrotic syndrome in indian children. A clinicopathological study of 206 Indian children with nephrotic syndrome showed a primary renal cause in 195 (96%), of which 77% were boys. In 126 children (96 boys, 30 girls) onset of the disorder occurred before the age of 5 years. Renal biopsy showed minimal lesions in 150 patients (77%); in 85 of these biopsy was done 3 months to 16 years after onset of the nephrotic syndrome. Significant renal histological abnormalities in 45 cases were labelled as mesangiocapillary 8, mesangioproliferative 4, proliferative with extensive crescents 2, membranous 3, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 9, focal global glomerulosclerosis 2, advanced nonspecific 8, and mild proliferative 9. Nephritic manifestations were mainly associated with significant renal lesions, which were more frequently encountered when the onset of disease was after the age of 5 years.

Twenty-four hr later, the awake rats were restrained and the carotid clasps tightened to produce 4-vessel occlusion. The carotid clasps were removed after 10, 20 or 30 min of 4-vessel occlusion and the animals killed by perfusion fixation 72 hr later. Rats which convulsed during the ischemic or post-ischemic period were excluded from further study. All rats subjected to 20 or 30 min of 4-vessel occlusion demonstrated ischemic neuronal damage. The H1 and paramedian hippocampus, striatum and layers 3, 5 and 6 of the posterior neocortex were the regions most frequently damaged.

As for other patients, survival varies inversely in relation to the important of the therapeutic means, but in the case of the elderly patient, there is a definite difference in the correlation mortality-therapeutic index towards aggravation, so one may determine a ceiling above which survival is not possible; 2--duration of the intensive care is very important.

      "The local effect of pH changes in the cerebrospinal fluid on the ventrolateral areas of medulla oblongata and on the spinal cord surface on the activity of cardiac and vertebral sympathetic nerves. Application of acid cerebrospinal fluid at pH 6.8 to the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata in cats increased the arterial blood pressure and the activity of the vertebral nerve and enhanced respiratory modulation of the vertebral and cardiac nerves. Alkaline cerebrospinal fluid at pH 7.7 applied to the ventral surface of the medulla oblongata increased the arterial blood pressure without changes in the sympathetic nerve activity. When the spinal cord was superfussed with artificial acid cerebrospinal fluid at the Th1 level the activity of the vertebral nerve and cardiac nerve increased and the arterial blood pressure rose. The authors discuss the possibility of regulation of the activity of sympathetic neurons in the medulla and spinal cord by means of direct action of pH and pCO2 on the neurons, or through an indirect effect mediated by superficial chemoreceptors of the medulla oblongata. The role of local changes of the brain blood flow in the mechanism of these results is discussed as well."

Several modifications of previous methods were introduced, e.g. kind of nuclide, particle size, pH, mode of application, measuring technique and reduction of local irradiation. Finally arrangements implying exact measurements of transport not only horizontally but also vertically or obliquely were obtained. No mucociliary transport was demonstrated in five of nine subjects with a common cold 10 days before or one week after the investigation. Xylometazolin as a nasal spray diminished the mucociliary transport significantly. In addition, the effects on mucociliary transport caused by homolateral or contralateral experimental nasal obstruction as well as by tobacco smoking were studied in healthy subjects. Finally, patients with various diseases: pollen allergy in free intervals, chronic rhinitis, septal deviation or perforation, and condition after laryngectomy were also investigated."

The activity of acid phosphatase in the testicular parenchyma of cattle was found to be higher than that in the endometrium. The acid phosphatase of either tissue broke up p-nitrophenylphosphate at a rate twice as high as that reached for di-sodium phenylphosphate. Hydrolysis of phenolphthalein diphosphate was slower and that of beta-glycerophosphate very slow. Two optimum pH values and two isozymes were recordable from acid phosphatase in testicular supernatant and three optimum pH values as well as three isozymes from that in endometrial supernatant. Even concentrations pf 0.2 mM of copper and mercury ions were strongly inhibiting the acid phosphatase, whereas lead and cadmium ions proved less effective. The activity of acid phosphatase from testes dropped by 24 per cent and that from the endometrium by 16 per cent over eight weeks of storage at -20 degrees C. The average activity of alkaline phosphatase in the endometrium was much higher than that in testicular parenchyma. Alkaline phosphatase from testes exhibited the shortest break-up time for p-nitrophenylphosphate, whereas disodium-phenylphosphate was broken up at the highest rate by endometrial alkaline phosphatase.

      "Gustatory responses of eel palatine receptors to amino acids and carboxylic acids. The gustatory receptors of the eel palate were found to be extremely sensitive to amino acids and carboxylic acids. The results obtained are as follows: (a) 11 amino acids which are among naturally occurring amino acids elicited responses in the palatine nerve, but 9 amino acids did not elicit a response even at a high concentration. The effect of D-amino acids was always much less than that of their corresponding L-isomers. There was no appreciable difference in the effectiveness of an alpha-amino acid (alpha-alanine) and beta-amino acid (beta-alanine). (b) The threshold concentrations of the most potent amino acids (arginine, glycine) were between 10(-8) and 10(-9) M. A linear relation between the magnitude of the response and log stimulus concentration held for a wide concentration range for all the amino acids examined. (c) The palatine receptors responded sensitively to various carboxylic acid solutions whose pH was adjusted to neutral. The threshold concentrations varied between 10(-4) and 10(-7) M. The magnitude of the response at 10(-2) M increased with an increase of carbon chain length. (d) The extent of cross-adaptation was examined with various combinations of amino acids. A variety of the response patterns showing complete cross-adaptation, no cross-adaptation, or synergetic interaction was observed. The synergetic interaction was also observed when one amino acid below its threshold concentration was added to the other amino acid below its threshold concentration was added to the other amino acid. No cross-adaptation was observed between amino acids and fatty acids. (e) The treatment of the palate with papain led to loss of the responses to arginine, glycine, and histidine without affecting those to proline and acetic acid. The treatment with pronase E eliminated selectively the response to proline. The possibility that the eel gustatory receptors are responsible for sensing food at a distance was discussed."

While it has been recognized for many years that different limb muscles belonging to the same mammal may have markedly differing contractile characteristics, it is only comparatively recently that it has been demonstrated that these differences depend upon the motor innervation. By appropriately changing the peripheral nerve innervating a mammalian skeletal muscle, it is possible to change dramatically the contractile behaviour of the reinnervated muscle. The manner by which the motor innervation determines the nature of a muscle fibre's contractile machinery is not completely understood, but it appears that the number and pattern of motor nerve impulses reaching the muscle play an important role. The biochemical changes occurring within muscle fibres whose contractile properties have been modified by altered motor innervation include the synthesis of different contractile proteins.",
      "Phosphofructokinase. III. Correlation of the regulatory kinetic and molecular properties of the rabbit muscle enzyme. It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation.",
      "The effect of some neuroleptics on the interaction of cortically and nigrally evoked potentials in the rat striatum. The interaction of cortico- and nigrofugal inputs to the striatum of the rat was investigated using the technique of evoked potentials. Repetitive, unilateral stimulation of the substantia nigra inhibited potentials which were evoked from the ipsilateral rostral cortex and recorded from the ipsilateral striatum. The inhibition was antagonized by low doses of various intraperitoneally administered neuroleptics such as: pimozide (0.1 - 0.2 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.1 - 0.5 mg/kg), chlorpromazine (0.5 - 2.0 mg/kg) and thioridazine (0.5 - 4.0 mg/kg). These findings are discussed in view of the existing controversy regarding the mode of action of dopamine in the striatum."

      "Chlorcyclizine induction of cleft palate in the rat: degradation of palatal glycosaminoglycans. Administration of the cleft palate teratogen chlorcyclizine or norchlorcyclizine to pregnant rats causes an alteration in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in embryonic palatal shelves. Pulse-chase experiments in vitro indicate that norchlorcyclizine enhances the degradation of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate but has little or no effect on their synthesis. These changes in GAGs are caused by concentrations of norchlorcyclizine that have no appreciable effect on DNA or protein synthesis. These findings suggest that degradation of palatal GAGs may be the primary biochemical defect responsible for the inhibition of palatal shelf elevation by norchlorcyclizine.",

      "The intraocular pressure response of conscious rabbits to clonidine.

Topical unilateral application of clonidine caused transient pupil dilatation and a biphasic intraocular pressure response; an initial hypertensive response preceded a hypotensive phase lasting several hours. Pupillary and hypertensive responses were absent in the untreated eye, but there was a rapid decrease of intraocular pressure. Intravenous administration of clonidine caused an immediate and large decrease of intraocular pressure in both eyes. Phenoxybenzamine given intravenously inhibited the pupillary dilatation and the hypertensive responses to clonidine. The role of efferent adrenergic neuronal activity in mediating the local biphasic pressure response was studied in rabbits with unilateral precervical and postcervical sympathotomy. The results showed the hypotensive response to be dependent on an intact adrenergic innervation of the ocular tissues.",

Clonidine caused a dose-dependent mydriasis which was effectively antagonized by pretreatment with yohimbine (1.5 mg/kg, i.v.). Pretreatment with phentolamine (5 mg/kg, i.v.) was less effective in antagonizing this clonidine-induced mydriasis. Phenoxybenzamine (2 mg/kg, i.v.) was almost without effect. In contrast, both phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine blocked the pupillary dilation produced by epinephrine while yohimbine pretreatment resulted in no antagonism of epinephrine-induced mydriasis. These results suggest that clonidine-induced mydriasis in the rat is mediated by a central adrenergic inhibitory mechanism."

The prevalence of mandibular lesions in the 1959-61 collection is believed to be the highest reported in wild caribou herds of North America. The frequency of occurrence of mandibular lesions was highest in caribou 7 years of age and older, and there was a higher prevalence in adult males than in adult females. Trauma, dental abscesses, and periodontal disease were the probably cause of most lesions. Pathogenic bacteria were not isolated from mandibular lesions from an 11 year-old female. Thirty-three of 98 (33.7%) mandibles with lesions were missing one tooth, while ten (10.2%) were missing more than one tooth.

      "The American Cleft Palate Association: its first 36 years. History involves memory, and sometimes memory is faulty. History requires documentation, and sometimes documents cannot be found. History demands winnowing, and sometimes the wheat and the chaff cannot be completely separated. History is an assembly of details, and details may become burdensome. History is a challenge, to which the historian tries to respond. Surely, earlier Historians of the American Cleft Palate Association must have encountered this challenge. The present Historian acknowledges the work of her predecessors: George H. Foster, W. J. Robinson, and William Harkins from dentistry and Gretchen M. Phair and Asa J. Berlin from speech pathology. In preparing this review of events that took place from 1943 to 1978, in the United States and in other countries, during times of war and times of relative peace, through difficulties and accomplishments, I have attempted to be as accurate as possible. If I have distorted facts and if I have omitted people and happenings that should have been included, I have not done so intentionally. As Historian of the American Cleft Palate Association, I have appreciated the opportunity to learn about the organization and the people, past and present, who have built and maintained it.

      "Structure and histogenesis of tooth plates in Sagenodus inaequalis Owen considered in relation to the phylogeny of post-Devonian dipnoans. The histology of tooth plates of Sagenodus inaequalis has been investigated to obtain information on the histogenesis of the tissue. The histological mechanisms of growth and replacement of the tooth plate are described in terms of an increase in area of the tooth plate by addition of denticles to the lateral margins of the ridges, replacement of worn dentine at the tritoral surface by basal growth of dentine and invasive growth of dentine into the surrounding bone at the anterior and medial margins. The histogenesis of a specialized character for dipnoans is described, namely hypermineralized dentine, or petrodentine, within the tooth plates. This has placed an advanced character further back in the phylogenetic organization of dipnoans than was previously recognized. The implications of these observations are discussed in relation to proposed phylogenies and previous observations on tooth plates of other dipnoans. It is concluded that Sagenodus inaequalis shared a common ancestor with both the ceratondontids and the lepidosirenids. A sequence is proposed for the phyletic relationship of tooth plate-bearing dipnoans. From a consideration of the features of histogenesis of this specialized dentine, the alternative terminologies are reviewed and petrodentine (Lison 1941) chosen for the hypermineralized dentine and syndentine (Thomasset 1928) as the collective term for the entire mass of dentine in the tooth plate."

      "Sensitivity of lateral cerebellar nucleus to macular stimulation in the rabbit. Experiments were performed in decerebrate rabbits to determine the sensitivity of the lateral cerebellar nucleus (LCN) to macular stimulation. Twenty-three percent of the neurons recorded extracellularly in the LCN showed steady changes in their discharge rate during 20 degrees tilt in both directions of the medial plane. Most of these neurons exhibited an alpha- and beta-type of response. A few gamma-types, but no delta-types were observed. The units sensitive to tilt were restricted to the caudal half of the LCN. Some of these positionally sensitive neurons responded monosynaptically to ipsilateral labyrinthine stimulation, but many received a polysynaptic input. These units could be activated antidromically by stimulation of the oculomotor nucleus but at a very high intensity suggesting current spread to the nearby brachium conjunctivum fibers.

These interventions lead to no result, irrespective of the time of the operation or the surgical technique. On the basis of the data of the literature and their material the authors came to the conclusion that since the alteration of the optic nerve has been histologically observed not only in the area of the optic nerve, but also in the free intracranial and intraorbital sector, this was the cause of the failure. The authors' five cases are demonstrated with light and electron microscopic examinations."

On the first loaded breath, ED and EIC increased reflexly due chiefly to prolongation of inspiration. Vagotomy or vagal cooling to block the Hering-Breuer reflex eliminated the increase in ED and diminished the increase in EIC. During the second to fifth breath, the level of EMG activity was disproportionately high for the level of PCO2, suggesting an additional reflex component over and above the reflex activity present on the first loaded breath.",
      "Sensitivity of the carotid body to within-breath changes in arterial PCO2. Respiration, sinus nerve chemoreceptor discharge, and carotid arterial pH were monitored in cats. Chemoreceptor discharge frequency showed oscillations that had a respiratory period when averaged over many respiratory cycles. These oscillations disappeared when pH oscillations of respiratory period were eliminated from the carotid arterial blood. The maximum sinus nerve discharge was associated with the most acid point of the recorded pH oscillation. Briefly increasing PCO2 by giving CO2-rich saline into the aortic root resulted in brief reduction in carotid arterial pH, and when this reduction occurred during inspiration tidal volume increased, even with a pH change no larger than the pH oscillations. However, increased chemoreceptor discharge could only be demonstrated when each pH change had twice the amplitude of the pH oscillations. Injections of fixed acid mixed with free carbonic anhydrase transiently increased chemoreceptor frequency, whereas injections of fixed acid alone had no effect. The carotid body is therefore sensitive to small rapid changes in arterial PCO2, and the pH electrode record indicates the size of the stimulus except when fixed acid changes are produced too closely upstream.",
      "Comparison of efflux rates of hydrogen and lactate ions from isolated muscles in vitro. Relative rates of efflux of hydrogen and lactate ions from skeletal muscle in vitro were determined on isolated rat diaphragms and frog satorius muscles. After a period of lacate accumulation by stimulation in vitro, muscles were suspended in a small volume of Ringer solution for different time periods lasting up to 60 min. The pH change in the solution was monitored continuously. After the predetermined time period, samples of the muscle and the Ringer solution were analysed for lactate content. Results showed that in both types of muscles the rate of efflux of hydrogen ions exceeded that of lactate ions by factors of about 14 and 50 in the case of diaphragm and sartorius muscles respectively. Because of this difference observed in the efflux kinetics of hydrogen and lactate ions, it is evident that the lactate content of a body compartment does not represent the absolute hydrogen ion load of the same compartment, particularly during the early phase of the efflux process."

Both testosterone and cyclic GMP stimulate DNA synthesis. Because cyclic GMP and testosterone seem to have similar actions, the objective of this investigation was to determine if testosterone and its precursors might have part of their mechanism of action through stimulation of guanylate cyclase [GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.2], the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cyclic GMP from GTP. The precursors--namely, progesterone, pregnenolone, 17 alpha-progesterone, 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone--caused a 2- to 3 1/2-fold enhancement of guanylate cyclase activity in rat liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, and ventral prostate at a concentration of 1 microM. These precursors are generated from cholesterol, which had no effect itself on guanylate cyclase activity. Testosterone, 19-nortestosterone, 17-methyltestosterone, and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone enhanced guanylate cyclase activity 2- to 5-fold in the same tissues at 1 microM. Etiocholanolone, androsterone, and epiandrosterone, metabolites of testosterone metabolism, enhanced guanylate cyclase activity 1 1/2- to 2-fold at this same concentration. Dose-response relationships revealed that testosterone and its precursors and metabolites had their maximal effect at 1 microM but still had some effect at 0.001 microM. The data in this investigation suggest that the guanylate cyclase-cyclic GMP system plays a role in the mechanism of action of testosterone and its precursors.",

The results were grouped according to various criteria, e.g. glans covered or uncovered and age of males. Differences in the distribution of germs could be found in relationship to age. In the case of an uncovered glans penis the presence of microbial flora corresponds to the grampositive saprophytic bacteria in areas rich in sebaceous glands. In the case of a covered glans the density of microorganisms increases.

The third type of profile was not found in the vas deferens or the metatarsal artery. It is therefore possible that this type of profile represents the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic inhibitory nerves, the presence of which has previously been pharmacologically indicated in these tissues."

Besides of others factors, caused by old age, the many cases of multiple extracranial stenoses are probably responsible for the overproportional big brain infarctions in this series. In nearly 50% of all stenoses we heard vascular murmurs, mostly in both of the carotid arteries.

      "The cat lung strip as an in vitro preparation of peripheral airways: a comparison of beta-adrenoceptor agonists, autacoids and anaphylactic challenge on the lung strip and trachea. 1 A new in vitro preparation, the isolated lung strip of the cat, is described for investigating the direct effect of drugs on the smooth muscle of the peripheral airways of the lung. The preparation comprises a thin strip of lung parenchyma which can be mounted in a conventional organ bath for isometric tension recording. Its pharmacological responses have been characterized and compared with the isolated tracheal preparation of the cat. 2 The lung strip exhibited an intrinsic tone which was relaxed by catecholamines, aminophylline and flufenamate. It was contracted strongly by histamine, prostaglandin F2alpha, acetylcholine, compound 48/80, potassium depolarizing solution and alternating current field stimulation. In contrast, the cat trachea was unresponsive to histamine and prostaglandin F2alpha and did not exhibit an intrinsic tone. 3 (-)-Isoprenaline and (-)-adrenaline were much more potent in relaxing the lung strip than the trachea. The potency order of relaxation responses to isoprenaline, adrenaline and (+/-)-noradrenaline in the lung strip was isoprenaline greater than adrenaline greater than noradrenaline but in the trachea was isoprenaline greater than noradrenaline greater than or equal to adrenaline. 4 beta2-Adrenoceptor selective agonists salbutamol and terbutaline were more potent in the lung strip than the trachea, suggesting beta2-adrenoceptors predominated in the lung strip. Propranolol was equipotent in inhibiting isoprenaline relexations of the lung strip and trachea, whereas practolol was much less effective in inhibiting lung strip than trachea, further supporting a predominance of beta2-adrenoceptors in lung strip and beta1-adrenoceptors in trachea. 5 Strong Schultz-Dale type contractions were elicited in both lung strips and trachea by Ascaris lumbricoides antigen in actively sensitized cats. The initial phase of the contractile response of the lung strip following challenge was shown to be due to histamine release and was absent in the trachea. The delayed phase of the contraction which took several minutes to develop in both the mepyramine-treated lung strip and trachea was not due to prostaglandins E1, F2alpha or bradykinin, the probable mediator being slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A). 6 It is concluded that the isolated lung strip of the cat is useful as an in vitro model for investigating the effect of drugs on the smooth muscle of the peripheral airways of the lungs.",

Ten aortas of each group were examined. The studies showed that in the aortas of the adult persons the content of HA, P, HS, KS and sulphate groups was considerably higher than that of the aourtas, obtained form the young persons. There was an impression that the adult factor affected substantialy the qualitative characteristics of GAG--with advancement of age the lenght of polysaccharide chains was shortened and the degree of sulphatation was increased. The accumulation of acid GAG in the aorta of adult persons impaired the metabolism of substances between blood and tissue, which enhanced the infiltration of the blood vessels with lipids and proteins, especialy when there was a blood increase in their content (hyperlipemia, hypercholesterinemia, ect.)"

      "Echocardiographic findings in patients with aortitis syndrome. Echocardiography was performed in 18 patients with the aortitis syndrome and in 20 age-matched normal volunteers. The aortic root dimension, the aortic dimension at the level of the sinotubular ridge, the aortic arch dimension, the left ventricular internal dimension, the left atrial dimension, the interventricular septal thickness, and the left ventricular posterior wall thickness were measured. All measurements, except for the left atrial dimension, were significantly greater in patients with aortitis syndrome than in the control subjects. We concluded (1) that the patients with the aortitis syndrome may have an enlarged or narrowed aorta, a dilated left ventricle and left atrium, and a thickened interventricular septum and left ventricular posterior wall; (2) that the incidence and the degree of these abnormalities depend on the presence of complications such as aortic regurgitation and arterial hypertension; and (3) that M-mode as well a cross-sectional echocardiography plays an important role in the assessment of the aorta and heart in the aortitis syndrome."

Elastic loads were applied for 1-20 breaths. The effects of changes in PCO2 on respiratory motor neuron output was assessed by applying loads during the course of CO2 rebreathing. On the first loaded breath, ED and EIC increased reflexly due chiefly to prolongation of inspiration. Vagotomy or vagal cooling to block the Hering-Breuer reflex eliminated the increase in ED and diminished the increase in EIC. During the second to fifth breath, the level of EMG activity was disproportionately high for the level of PCO2, suggesting an additional reflex component over and above the reflex activity present on the first loaded breath.",

By contrast, samples taken from the superficial portion of the masseter demonstrated several unusual characteristics: these included a striking inequality of muscle fibre size in that the Type II fibres were much smaller than those of Type I but exceeded the latter in total number. This part of the muscle also contained, in 6 out of 10 samples, substantial numbers of intermediate fibres identified by myofibrillar ATPase staining. This study has confirmed that the superficial part of the human masseter is different morphologically and presumably functionally from the middle and deep parts of the muscle.",
      "Post-tetanic enhancement of stimulus-induced muscarinic afterdischarge in the rat superior cervical ganglion. The enhancement of asynchronous muscarinic ganglionic firing which follows a preganglionic nerve stimulus volley by high frequency repetitive conditioning stimuli was studied in the rat isolated superior cervical ganglion. Muscarinic afterdischarge which occurred in chlorisondamine-blocked ganglia was enhanced for up to 1 hr after a 40 Hz conditioning volley lasting 7.5 to 30 sec. Enhancement did not occur when release of acetylcholine was blocked by reducing the calcium in the modified Krebs' solution or when magnesium or manganese chlorides were added to the saline during the conditioning period. Metabolic inhibitors, dinitrophenol, sodium azide and ouabain, blocked the enhancement process but not the asynchronous muscarinic firing. Phenytoin, 10(-6) M, did not reduce the enhancement of firing. Dopamine, 5 X 10(-5) M, had no effect on muscarinic afterdischarge, but dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, 5 and 10 X 10(=3) M, caused a 43 and 53% increase in the maximum amplitude of afterdischarge. Dibutyryl cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate had no effect on post-tetanic enhancement or afterdischarge in concentrations up to 1 X 10(-3) M. A working hypothesis is proposed: following a conditioning stimulus, a prolonged postsynaptic change occurs which results in an increased responsiveness to muscarinic agonists, and this change probably involves a metabolic reaction since it is reduced by metabolic inhibitors. Evidence to support the concept that dopamine is a modulator of enhancement in the rat superior cervical ganglion was not obtained."

This indicates that bethanechol increases the permeability of the cell membranes to potassium ions in the submandibular gland but not in the pancreas.

      "Reversible anti-fertility effect by non-occluding oviductal copper coils in the rabbit. Placement of two 1 cm copper (Cu) coils around the mid-region of each oviduct in a group of five female rabbits with proven fertility, 34 days before mating, virtually prevented fetal implantation in these animals. The oviducts remained patent during a 47 day implantation period and following removal of the Cu coils, does that were remated became pregnant. In two of these does an implantation rate (living fetuses/corpora lutea) of 33% (7/21) was observed and one post-Cu implanted doe had a litter of two. Among four does bearing a single Cu coil on their left oviduct for 28 days prior to mating there was 19% (4/21) implantation of the left side and 56.3% (9/16) on the untreated right side, suggesting a local action by the metal. The results indicate that Cu is an effective anti-fertility agent when implanted around the oviducts and, as a corollary, it is apparent that the metal is not restricted to placement in the uterus in order to prevent pregnancy in rabbits. Non-occluding Cu containing devices may offer a new approach to reversible fertility control in the female that merits further investigation."

The initial evidence of secretion of peritrophic membrane precursors occurred at 8-12 h after ingestion of the bloodmeal. Morphogenesis of the peritrophic membrane occurred within 12-16 h after the initial secretion; culminating with a fibrous, multilayered peritrophic membrane 20-24 h after bloodmeal ingestion. A discussion of the potential participation of the peritrophic membrane in a midgut barrier to infection by arboviruses is presented. The participation of the peritrophic membrane in a midgut barrier to infection of C. tarsalis, and many other mosquito species, by arboviruses is considered a moot point.",
      "Capsid transformation during packaging of bacteriophage lambdaDNA. Assembly pathways of complex viruses might not be simple additions of one protein after another with rigid tertiary structure. It might in fact involve shifts in subunit structure, movement of subunits relative to each other to form new arrangements, transient action of proteins and protein segments, involvement of structure forming 'microenvironments' of the host. Thus morphogenesis of the bacteriophage lambda head starts with the formation of a core-containing DNA-free petit lambda particle. In a first transition, and dependent on a host function, the core is released, minor protein components of the capsid are processed and the particle's structure is altered, as shown by a change of its hydrodynamic properties. The resulting 'prehead' undergoes a second transition triggered by a complex of DNA and recognition protein (A-protein). This transition is more drastic than the first one. The particle doubles its volume without increasing in protein mass, the shell becomes thinner, and the surface structure is changed. Concomitantly with this process, the DNA becomes packaged and the particle becomes able to bind the small 'D-protein' in amounts equimolar to the capsid protein, which it could not do before. The D-protein addition probably causes another shift of the capsid structure. DNA packaging is completed, and the DNA is cut from concatemeric precursors to unit length molecules. Binding sites are created for the tail connector molecules which in turn allow the independently assembled tail to attach. Research on these processes proceeds along several lines: comparison of physical and chemical properties of particles accumulating in mutants; pulse-chase experiments on assembly precursors; morphogenesis in vitro; and model transitions of aberrant lambda polyheads.",

Thyroid parafollicular cell proliferation could not be proved by immunohistochemical or electron microscopical studies.

      "Etiology, clinical features and prognosis in secondary amenorrhea. A clinical investigation of 356 patients with secondary amenorrhea revealed that 95% of patients with postpill amenorrhea and 56% of patients with anorexia nervosa recovered in 6 years. The corresponding recovery rates for patients with psychogenic amenorrhea and amenorrhea following self-induced weight loss were 72% for both groups, and in patients with the amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome and idiophatic functional amenorrhea the recovery rates at 6 years were 64 and 61% respectively. Unlike the other groups with functional amenorrhea, patients with the amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome had impaired ovarian responsiveness to exogenous gonadotropins. Bromocriptine treatment resulted in disappearance of the galactorrhea and restoration of the menses and/or ovulation in nine of 18 patients; of these three became pregnant. The effect of bromocriptine did not persist for long after treatment ceased, and permanent recovery was recorded only in four patients. The group with functional amenorrhea included 34 patients who wished to become pregnant. Gonadotropin treatment was successful in 20 patients, clomiphene-hCG in two, tamoxifen in two, bromocriptine in two, and combined bromocriptine and clomiphene in one. Thus, the overall pregnancy rate in patients with functional amenorrhea was 79%. The groups with ovarian amenorrhea inclutients with assumed ovarian failure responded to large doses of exogenous gonadotropins by ovulation and three became pregnant.

Maximal change of redox state was observed during ventilation with carbon monoxide; surface fluorescence increased 6.6%, lactate/pyruvate increased 5.8 times, glycerol 3-P/dihydroxyacetone-P increased fourfold and glutamate/alpha-ketoglutarate doubled. KCN infusion resulted in similar changes. Hypoxia produced with N2 ventilation resulted in less than maximal changes in redox couple ratios until alveolar PO2 was reduced below 0.1 mmHg.

Neither type of proteinoid formed spheres on 10-minute exposure to ammonia or methane-hydrogen-ammonia atmospheres. (Brief exposure resulted in spheres from basic proteinoid.) The effects, both qualitative and quantitative, were indicated by control experiments to be due to pH, rather than to the specific gas (or ion).

      "Dependence of phrenic motoneurone output on the oscillatory component of arterial blood gas composition. 1. The hypothesis that respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition influence ventilation has been examined. 2. Phrenic motoneurone output recorded in the C5 root of the left phrenic nerve and the respiratory oscillations of arterial pH in the right common carotid artery were measured in vagotomized anaesthetized dogs which had been paralysed and artificially ventilated. 3. The effect of a change in tidal volume for one or two breaths on phrenic motoneurone output was measured with the inspiratory pump set at a constant frequency similar to, and in phase with, the animal's own respiratory frequency. A reduction of tidal volume to zero or an increase by 30% led to a corresponding change of mean carotid artery pH level. The changes of carotid artery pH resulted in a change of phrenic motoneurone output, predominantly of expiratory time (Te) but to a lesser extent of inspiratory time (T1) and also peak amplitude of 'integrated' phrenic motoneurone output (Phr). Denervation of the carotid bifurcation blocked this response. 4. The onset of movement of the inspiratory pump was triggered by the onset of phrenic motoneurone output. When a time delay was interposed between them, the phase relationship between respiratory oscillations of arterial pH and phrenic motoneurone output altered. The dominant effect was to alter Te; smaller and less consistent changes of Phr and T1 were observed. 5. When the inspiratory pump was maintained at a constant frequency but independent of and slightly different from the animal's own respiratory frequency (as judged by phrenic motoneurone output), the phase relationship between phrenic motoneurone output and the respiratory oscillations of pH changed breath by breath over a sequence of 100-200 breaths, without change of the mean level of arterial blood gas composition. Te varied by up to 30% about its mean value depending on the phase relationship. Ti and Phr were also dependent on the phase relationship but varied to a lesser extent. The changes were comparable to the results obtained in paragraph 4. 6. It was concluded that phrenic motoneurone output is dependent in part on its relationship to the respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition. 7. Information concerning a transient ventilatory disturbance is stored in the arterial blood in the form of an altered pattern of the respiratory oscillations of blood gas composition; this in turn can change breathing by an effect on the carotid bodies."

Despite many therapies have been proposed, their efficiency seems to be rather small when they are used alone. Usually, it is necessary to act on several factors with a combination of therapeutic methods. Absorptive hypercalciuria are improved with both low calcium diets and inhibitors of calcium absorption. In renal hypercalciuria, the treatment is based on the administration of thiazide diuretics which enhance calcium renal tubular reabsorption. The other therapeutic methods depend on the nature of renal stones: urinary acidification for calcium phosphate; administration of succinimide, oral phosphate or organic phosphonates for calcium oxalate stones; association with purine biosynthesis inhibitors in case of the presence of urates in renal calculi.",
      "Dissolution of urinary stones by calcium-chelating agents: A study using a model system. Pellets made by dispersing microcrystals of calcium oxalate monohydrate throughout an organic matrix have served as models for kidney stones in studies of factors governing their dissolution by calcium-chelating agents. These factors include pH, ionic strength, concentration of chelating agent, and addition of other acids and bases. The method shows good reproducibility. Results have been applied to improving a clinical procedure for kidney stone dissolution."

They then discuss the various causes that must be investigated in all cases of painful ophtalmoplegia. They consider in order: -- ophtalmoplegia due to general causes (especially diabetes) and neurological causes (e.g. multiple sclerosis); -- ophtalmoplegia due to common local canses space-occupying processes, vascular malformations, ear, nose and larynx infections); -- painful ophalmoplegia of unknown origin, which includes four entities of very differing importance (Gubler and Charcot's ophthalmoplegic migraine and Tolosa-Hunt syndrome of which the clinical symptoms and course are so different that they can be distinguished as two entities; and, secondarily, inflammatory pseudo-tumours of the orbit and the recurrent multiple cranial nerve palsies that are observed in South-East Asia).

      "Facial vein in the rabbit. Neurogenic vasodilation mediated by beta-adrenergic receptors. A segment of the facial vein of the rabbit, that opposite the buccal cavity, responds to norepinephrine (NE) and opposite the buccal cavity, responds to norepinephrine (NE) and transmural nerve stimulation (TNS) by a brisk biphasic dilation. The dilation in response to both procedures is reveresed by prior exposure to propranolol (10(-6)M). Pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (10(-5)M) increases the size of the neurogenic response and displaces the NE dose-relaxation curve to the left. Histamine causes a constrictor response exclusively. Sympathetic stimulation of a segment of the facial vein proximal to this buccal segment, and also of the external jugular vein, results in constriction. Light microscopy showed no fequtres which can account for the dilation, and fluorescence histochemistry using a modified Flack technique showed a dense adrenergic nerve plexus extending throughout the thickness of the media. We found that frequency-response characteristics and neuronal uptake of 3H-NE were consistent with findings for a blood vessel with a heavy medial innervation. Also, monoamine oxidase and catechol O-methyltransferase activities were similar to those found in other rabbit veins. Furthermore, these results are consistent with an adrenergic neuroeffector organization in which there is a predominance of beta- over alpha-adrenergic receptors. In conclusion, the presence of a dilator response in this buccal segment of the facial vein may be related to its location in the wall of the cheek, where it may be subjected to considerable stretch.",

By single radial immunodiffusion, measurable amounts of IgM were found in the secretions of 15 patients, and of IgA and IgG in the secretion of all patients. In purulent sinus secretion, IgA levels were significantly lower than in serous secretion. Of the total content of IgA in sinus secretion, 30% (purulent secretion) and 43% (serous secretion) were calculated to be locally produced, on average. For IgG these figures were 15% (purulent secretion) and 18% (serous secretion), whereas IgM could not be estimated by the method used. It was also concluded that the maxillary sinus is a suitable organ for investigation of local immunity in regard to bacterial infections."

Having observed 18 cases, the authors describe a syndrome of recurrent paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia which was very homogeneous from the clinical and ECG point of view. It was usually found in middle aged males, with no demonstrable underlying heart disease, whose disorder of intra-atrial conduction occurred during sinus rhythm. The condition developed slowly over the course of years towards a maximum incidence of several short daily attacks of an arrhythmia which alternated between an atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Vagal overactivity is the precipitating cause of these attacks which are usually not completely nocturnal. The condition never progressed to sino-atrial block nor to permanent fibrillation. The beginning of each attack, often heralded by atrial coupling with a long enough interval to cause re-entry, is accompanied by slowing of the sinus rate down to the threshold level. The vagal effect of shortening the action potential and refractory period is recognised to be non-homogeneous in the atrial wall, and suggests a re-entry mechanism rather than hyper-excitability. This would explain the usual resistance of atrial arrhythmias of vagal origin to digitalis, beta blockers and quinidine. Amiodarone alone is usually effective because of the prolongation of the action potential which it causes. In 5 particularly resistant cases a good clinical result was obtained by the insertion of an atrial pacemaker with a fairly rapid rate.",

      "Pharmacologic responses of cells of a neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid clone and modulation of synapses between hybrid cells and mouse myotubes. Cells of the hybrid clone NG108-15 responded to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine or acetylcholine with graded depolarizations involving membrane conductance increases. Responses desensitized during continuous application of the neurotransmitters, and responses to 5-HT and dopamine cross-desensitized: a desensitizing application of one neurotransmitter also desensitized the hybrd cell to the other neurotransmitter. 5-HT and acetylcholine did not cross-desensitize. The hybrid cell 5-HT response was not attenuated by D-LSD, and was blocked by 10(-5) M morphine, although not via binding to naloxone-sensitive opiate receptors. 5-HT or the prostaglandin PGF2alpha caused the release of acetylcholine at the synapses of hybrid cells with mouse myotubes. Application of 5-HT or PGF2alpha also facilitated the synaptic release elicited by hybrid cell action potentials. Following treatment with the antimitotic agent cytosine arabinoside, co-cultures of hybrid cells and mouse myotubes exhibited plentiful synaptic connections only if maintained in medium containing 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP (dBcAMP). After X-irradiation, co-cultures were synaptically active even in the absence of dBcAMP. Thus, methods have been found to regulate both the short-term and long-term synaptic activity of NG108-15 hybrid cells."

His classification is compared with Lauge-Hansen's and Weber's classification. Critical analysis of these two last classifications is given.

      "CO2-inhibition of the amplitude of bending of triton-demembranated sea urcin sperm flagella.

Although KHCO3 itself causes a small inhibition of flagellar beat frequency, the results confirm previous observations of a direct inhibition of flagellar bend angle by CO2 with no effect of CO2 on frequency. Observation of the effect of pH on the inhibition of bend angle in solutions containing KHCO3 indicates that a given concentration of OH- has a similar effect to the same concentration of HCO3-, as would be expected if CO2- inhibition results from reaction of CO2 with protein-NH3+ groups to form carbamates. CO2 may interfere with a control mechanism which selectively suppresses dynein cross-bridge activity in order to generate rhythmic bending. This control mechanism may incorporate a feedback control involving a measure of flagellar amplitude, which fails to operate successfully when the amplitude is reduced below a critical level."

Introduction of either water or milk produced apnea, bradycardia, and hypertension. Swab application of test fluids to the laryngeal epithelium produced similar responses. The reflex could be interrupted by flushing the laryngeal region with saline, by cutting the superior laryngeal nerves (SLN) or by anesthetizing the laryngeal epithelium with lidocaine. Electrical stimulation of SLN elicited identical responses. Respiratory inhibition by the reflex was enhanced following central depression with chloralose and overridden by administration of the respiratory stimulant, aminophylline. The relative potency of the laryngeal reflex was estimated to be equivalent to about 40% of the dose of chloralose which produced permanent respiratory arrest.

      "Dependence of phrenic motoneurone output on the oscillatory component of arterial blood gas composition. 1. The hypothesis that respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition influence ventilation has been examined. 2. Phrenic motoneurone output recorded in the C5 root of the left phrenic nerve and the respiratory oscillations of arterial pH in the right common carotid artery were measured in vagotomized anaesthetized dogs which had been paralysed and artificially ventilated. 3. The effect of a change in tidal volume for one or two breaths on phrenic motoneurone output was measured with the inspiratory pump set at a constant frequency similar to, and in phase with, the animal's own respiratory frequency. A reduction of tidal volume to zero or an increase by 30% led to a corresponding change of mean carotid artery pH level. The changes of carotid artery pH resulted in a change of phrenic motoneurone output, predominantly of expiratory time (Te) but to a lesser extent of inspiratory time (T1) and also peak amplitude of 'integrated' phrenic motoneurone output (Phr). Denervation of the carotid bifurcation blocked this response. 4. The onset of movement of the inspiratory pump was triggered by the onset of phrenic motoneurone output. When a time delay was interposed between them, the phase relationship between respiratory oscillations of arterial pH and phrenic motoneurone output altered. The dominant effect was to alter Te; smaller and less consistent changes of Phr and T1 were observed. 5. When the inspiratory pump was maintained at a constant frequency but independent of and slightly different from the animal's own respiratory frequency (as judged by phrenic motoneurone output), the phase relationship between phrenic motoneurone output and the respiratory oscillations of pH changed breath by breath over a sequence of 100-200 breaths, without change of the mean level of arterial blood gas composition. Te varied by up to 30% about its mean value depending on the phase relationship. Ti and Phr were also dependent on the phase relationship but varied to a lesser extent. The changes were comparable to the results obtained in paragraph 4. 6. It was concluded that phrenic motoneurone output is dependent in part on its relationship to the respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition. 7. Information concerning a transient ventilatory disturbance is stored in the arterial blood in the form of an altered pattern of the respiratory oscillations of blood gas composition; this in turn can change breathing by an effect on the carotid bodies."

Ingestion of RSD after ligation at the end of the duodenum, end of the ileum or one of the cacea, or injection of soya-bean trypsin inhibitor into a aligated caecum, indicated that there is no amylase synthesis by the intestinal tract cells or microflora as a response to the presence of RSD or trypsin inhibitors. 4. It seems that amylase found in the digestive tract of the chick is of pancreatic origin and the RSD or trypsin inhibitors induce higher pancreatic amylase secretion than HSD which (the additiona amylase) accumulates mainly in the caeca."

      "Patterns of gastroesophageal reflux in health and disease. Twenty-four pH monitoring the distal esophagus quantitates gastroesophageal reflux in a near physiologic setting by measuring the frequency and duration of acid exposure to the esophageal mucosa. Fifteen asymptomatic volunteers were studies with 24-hour pH and esophageal manometry. The normal cardia was more competent supine than in the upright position. Physiologic reflux was unaffected by age, rarely occurred during slumber, and was the rule after alimentation. One hundred symptomatic pateitns with an abnormal 24-hour pH record (2 S.D. above the mean of controls) could be divided into three patterns of pathological reflux: those who refluxed only in the upright position (9), only in the supine position (37), and in both positions (54). Upright differed from supine refluxers by excessive aerophagia causing reflux episodes by repetitive belching. Compared to controls, they had excessive post-prandial reflux, lower DES pressure, and less DES exposed to the positive pressure of the abdomen. Supine differed from upright refluxers by having a higher incidence of esophagitis and an inability to clear the esophagus of acid after a supine reflux episode. Compared to controls, they had only a lower DES pressure. Combined refluxers had a higher incidence of esophagitis than supine refluxers. Stricture (15%) was seen only in this group. They were similar to supine refluxers in their inability to clear a supine reflux episode. Compared to controls, they had a lower DES pressure and less DES exposed to the positive pressure of the abdomen. Forty of the 100 patients had an antireflux procedure (4 upright, 8 supine, 28 combined). The most severe postoperative flatus and abdominal distention was seen in the upright refluxers. It is concluded that minimal reflux is physiological. Patients with pathological reflux all have lower DES pressure. Patients with upright reflux have less of their DES exposed to the positive pressure environment of the abdomen. Patients with supine reflux have an inability to clear the esophagus of reflux acid and are prone to develop esophagitis. Patients with both upright and supine reflux have the most severe disease and are at risk in developing strictures. In patients with only upright reflux, aerophagia and delayed gastric emptying may be an important etiological factor."

The tube is composed of a polar tube protein (PTP) which consists of a single, low molecular weight polypeptide slightly smaller than chymotrypsinogen-A. Assembled PTP tubes resist dissociation in sodium dodecyl sulfate and brief exposures in media at extreme ends of the pH range; however, the tubes are reduced by mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol. When acidified, mercaptoethanol-reduced PTP self-assembles into plastic, two-dimensional monolayers. Dithiothreitol-reduced PTP will not reassemble when acidified. Evidence is presented which indicates that PTP is assembled as a tube within the spore; that the ejected tube has plasticity during sporoplasm passage; and, finally, that the subunits within the tube polymer are bound together, in part, by interprotein disulfide linkages."

I. Bile collection and composition. Bile composition and secretion were studied in tow elasmobranch species, Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish shark) and Raja erinacea (small skate), after ligation of the common duct and insertion of cannulas into the gallbladder lumen. Fish were then allowed to swim freely in large pools and bile was collected in balloons attached to the externalized cannulas. Both species secreted bile for periods of 4-7 days at a maximum rate of 1.77 +/- .89 ml/kg per 24 h in Squalus acanthias and 2.66 +/- .89 ml/kg per 24 h in Raja erinacea. Comparison of the composition of cannula and gallbladder bile indicated that hepatic bile could be collected by this technique in both species without effective contact with gallbladder epithelium. The low concentrations of HCO3- and CL- and the gigh bile salt levels in dogfish gallbladder bile indicate that mechanisms for concentration and acidification of bile in the gallbladder developed early in vertebrate evolution. These results indicate that gallbladder cannulation in free-swimming elasmobranchs is a useful technique for the study of bile secretory and excretory function in marine species.",
      "Ultrastructural findings in the mouse exocrine pancreas during graft-versus host reaction. 12- to 36-hours-old newborn CBA mice were intraperitoneally injected each with 10 X 10(6) allogeneic spleen cells of adult C57Bl mice.

Acute lethal pancreatic cell damages on the day after the intraperitoneal injection of allogeneic spleen cells. 2. Membrane-lined inclusion vacuoles between the 7th and 21st experimental day. 3. Atrophy of pancreatic acinar cells in the terminal stage of a severe graft-versus-host disease.

      "Kinetics of thymus-derived lymphocyte count changes in rats affected by graft-versus-host reaction. The effect of GVHR on thymus-dependent lymphocytes of various lymphoid organs has been followed autoradiographically and by scintillation technique in a temporal dependence on the induction of the reaction. GVHR was induced in (BD X Lw) F1 hybrid rats with parental spleen (BD) cells. As marker of the thymus-dependent lymphocytes the in vitro 3H-uridine incorporation was used. Compared to B cells, T lymphocytes of rats have a higher ability of incorporating labeled uridine. T lymphocytes in peripheral blood and the thoracic duct achieved their peak at 3 or 4 days following GVHR induction. On the fourth day, simultaneously with a GVH-altered thymus a rapid decline in the number of these cells was also observed. A mobilization of T lymphocytes from the spleen and lymph nodes into the circulation already in the very first days of the reaction might be responsible for the peak seen in PBL and TDL. The GVH-alteration lasting 21 days caused an evident reduction of thymus-dependent lymphocytes in all the organs studied here. The immunological attack of GVHR is considered to be primarily responsible for the exhaustion of T cells. The discussion bears on the possibility of a more progressive action of GVHR on the more mature T lymphocyte subpopulation."

An ultrastructural study of Kulschitsky cells was made on lung tissue from five human fetuses of gestational ages between 18 and 25 weeks. The cells were found to occur with relative frequency throughout the bronchi and bronchioles, as well as in the developing saccules. This report describes in detail the cells of the terminal bronchioles and saccules, where their long cytoplasmic processes weave through the epithelium and come into contact with intercellular spaces and the lumen. The cytoplasmic organelles have an orderly arrangement comparable to secreting cells. Dense core vesicles characterise the cytoplasm but clear vesicles and some with less dense, diffuse cores are also present, and may be seen outside the plasma membrane and in the interstitial spaces. The K-cells are usually colsely associated with capillaries or smooth muscle cells across the basement membrane. In addition, the rare occurrence of a small unmyelinated nerve fibre in the vicinity of a K-cell in a terminal bronchiole raises the possibility that the cells fulfill a type of 'mini receptor' role in addition to their probable vasoactive one. Evidence is given that K-cells divide in human fetal lung."

Formation of bilirubin monoglucuronide from unconjugated bilirubin requires a microsomal enzyme, UDP-glucuronate glucuronyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.17). Conversion of bilirubin monoglucuronide to bilirubin diglucuronide, the major bilirubin conjugate in bile, was studied in subcellular fractions of rat liver. The highest specific activity for bilirubin diglucuronide formation occurred in a fraction highly enriched in plasma membranes. Studies of reaction stoichiometry and utilization of UDP-D-[14C]glucuronic acid revealed that conversion of bilirubin monoglucuronide to bilirubin diglucuronide is not catalyzed by UDP-glucuronyltransferase, and results from transglucuronidation of bilirubin monoglucuronide, with formation of bilirubin diglucuronide and unconjugated bilirubin. When unconjugated bilirubin was infused intravenously into rats at rates exceeding the maximal hepatic excretory capacity, bilirubin monoglucuronide accumulated in serum and bilirubin diglucuronide was found exclusively in bile as the predominant bilirubin metabolite. These results suggest that formation of bilirubin diglucuronide occurs at the surface membrane of the liver cell.

Local inflammation evoked in Swiss albino mice by subcutaneous injection of Celite resulted in a rise of liver tyrosine aminotransferase activity and plasma level of fibrinogen and seromucoid, while liver alanine aminotransferase activity and plasma level of fibrinogen and seromucoid, while liver alanine aminotransferase activity and the plasma level of albumin and total protein remained unaltered. By measuring the incorporation of [14C] leucine, stimulation of liver and plasms protein synthesis by Celite injection was demonstrated. Administration of D-galactosamine (2-5 mg/10 g body weight) inhibited the enhanced synthesis of liver proteins, and especially of trauma-induced synthesis of plasma fibrinogen and seromucoid. The inhibitory effect of galactosamine was most pronounced when the amino sugar was injected simultaneously with Celite and then protein synthesis was measured 6 h later. The results obtained support the idea that high doses of galactosamine inhibit transcription of trauma-inducible mRNA in the liver and thus block the acute-phase response."

In conscious fullgrown minipigs simple SPV alone, SPV and pyloric stenosis and SPV and pyloroplasty were performed. After a liquid test meal the motoric and secretory function of the stomach were examined simultaneously by a modified method of intestinal perfusion and aspiration. After simple SPV initially a marked decrease of gastric volume and normal emptying into the duodenum were found. With additional pyloric stenosis no significant change was found. The pyloroplasty lead to an increase of gastric volume and delayed emptying. The acid secretion after feeding reduced by SPV was not changed significantly neither by pyloroplasty nor by pyloric stenosis. The baseline values of serum gastrin were elevated after SPV as well as after SPV in combination with pyloric stenosis or pyloroplasty. After food stimulation there was a delayed increase of gastrin after SPV which differed from that after SPV with pyloric stenosis or pyloroplasty only during the first hour. These results show that after SPV no further improvement of the motoric and secretory function can be achieved by an additional pyloroplasty. Furthermore these findings permit the conclusion that even after SPV with additional artificial pyloric stenosis no delayed gastric emptying occurs and that there is no negative effect postoperatively on the acid secretion and gastrin production.",
      "Oesophageal function in cirrhotic patients undergoing injection sclerotherapy for oesophageal varices. Oesophageal function has been studied in three groups of cirrhotic patients: those without varices, those with varices and those with varices treated by injection sclerotherapy. Using the Honeywell Model 31 oesophageal motility probe and the Ingold combined stomach pH electrode, measurements were made of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and length, swallowing responses, reflux and clearance of acid. The presence of varices was associated with an increase in LES length and reduced lower oesophageal contraction pressure during swallowing and some failure of sphincter relaxation during swallowing. Sclerotherapy was associated with a reduction in the maximum LES pressure both at rest and during swallowing, and an impairment of acid clearance, but postural reflux of acid was not observed in any patient.",
      "Lower esophageal sphincter pressure in cirrhotic men with ascites: before and after diuresis. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) was measured in 10 biopsy-proved cirrhotics with esophageal varices and tense ascites before and after diuresis to evaluate of ascites might play in the development of variceal bleeding. In the 10 cirrhotic men studied, basal LESP was 30.9 +/- 1.7 mm Hg before and 22.7 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) after a diuresis which resulted in a mean 12-kg weight loss. LESP responses to abdominal compression were also evaluated. The change in LESP in response to a standard degree of abdominal compression was greater in the presence of ascites (8.5 +/- 0.4) than in its absence (6.3 +/- 0.4) (P less than 0.01). Basal gastric pH and fasting plasma gastrin concentrations did not differ during the two testing periods. Based on these data and the rarity with which cirrhotic patients with ascites complain of heartburn, it is concluded that reflux esophagitis caused by failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to remain competent is unlikely to be a significant etiological factor in the development of variceal bleeding."

      "The nasopharyngeal culture in acute otitis media. A reappraisal of its usefulness. Simultaneous cultures of the nasopharynx and middle ear exudate (obtained by tympanocentesis) were obtained from 225 children (mean age, 34 months; median age, 41 months) with suppurative otitis media. A 72% prediction rate for middle ear pathogens was obtained by examining the nasopharyngeal cultures after the strict observance of two essential prerequisites: (1) the nasopharyngeal culture was immediately plated on appropriate solid agar and (2) a semiquantitative method for bacterial enumeration was employed in the reading of the nasopharyngeal culture plates. The technique was most valuable where 2+ (greater than 25% up to 50% of total number of colonies was a single pathogen) or greater of a single pathogen was recovered from the nasopharynx. In only one instance, the semiquantitative nasopharyngeal culture incorrectly predicted the middle ear pathogen if one was recovered. Quantitative nasopharyngeal cultures were particularly useful in predicting the presence of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and group A streptococci as causative agents in otitis media."

      "Rates of block by procaine and benzocaine and the procaine-benzocaine interaction at the node of Ranvier. 1. Action potentials and their maximum rates of rise, VA, were measured in single myelinated nerve fibres of the frog, Rana esculenta at room temperature. 2. On applying 1 mM procaine (pH 7.2) at 20 Hz stimulus frequency, half of the final VA reduction was reached at ton = 0.27 s; on applying 0.5 mM benzocaine (pH 7,2) at 50 HZ, ton was 0.12 s. Increasing the stimulus frequency between 2 and 50 HZ increased the rate of block by procaine but not by benzocaine. 3. Recovery in Ringer solution (pH 7.2) from 30-s treatment with 1 mM procaine (pH 7.2), the equieffective 0.15 mM procaine (pH 8.9) and from 0.5 mM benzocaine (pH 7.2) was 54%, 31% and 70%, respectively, within 1 s. 4. Changing between alkaline Ringer solution (pH 8.9) and 1 mM procaine (pH 7.2) led to transitory excessive block. Changing between 1 mM procaine (pH 7.2) and acid Ringer solution (pH 6.0) and washing out 10 mM procaine (pH 5.5) with neutral Ringer solution also led to a non-monotonic change in VA. 5. If hyperpolarizing pulses (30 ms, 20 mV) preceded the stimuli, changing the frequency of the pulse pairs led to a gradual moderate relief of block in procaine, turning off prepulses (at 10 HZ) to a gradual increase of block. In benzocaine changing from 1 to 10 HZ had no effect but turning off prepulses led to a prompt large increase of block. In procaine + benzocaine the membrane responded much as in benzocaine alone. At 1 HZ (prepulses) VA in 0.4 mM procaine was smaller than in 0.4 mM procaine + 0.3 mM benzocaine. 6. These phenomena can be explained on the assumption of voltage-dependent binding of benzocaine and procaine to a common receptor. The rate of block appears to be limited by access to the receptor, more in the case of benzocaine than of procaine.",
      "Localization of substance P-like immunoreactivity in nerves in the tooth pulp. The occurrence of substance P (SP)-like immunoreactivity was studied in dental pulps of the cat. In untreated animals SP-positive fibres were found in all areas of the pulp. Most fibres were seen in central parts of the pulp but they were also observed in relation to the odontoblasts. Single, possibly unmyelinated, or fine caliber fibres or small bundles of them were seen running close to large non-fluorescent myelinated nerves, to blood vessels or without any obvious association with either of these structures. Fourteen days after transection of the inferior alveolar nerve no SP-positive fibres were observed in pulps on the denervated side. Transection of the cervical sympathetic ganglion did not change the occurrence of SP-positive fibres. The results indicate the existence of at least two types of afferent fibres in the dental pulp of the cat. Since the tooth pulp has been demonstrated to give rise only to pain sensation when stimulated, the results give morphological support for a role of SP neurones in pain transmission."

      "General pharmacological properties of a new non-opiate antitussive: zipeprol (3024 CERM). I. Action on respiratory function and acute toxicity. 1-(2-Methoxy-2-phenyl)-ethyl-4-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-3-phenyl)-propyl-iperazine-dihydrochloride (zipeprol, Respilene) is a substance of non-phenanthrenic chemical structure. In the cat, it antagonised cough induced by stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve or by direct mechanical excitation of the sensitive tracheo-bronchial receptors. The efficacy of zipeprol after enteral administration made it possible both to establish good intestinal absorption and to rank it favourably in relation to several major antitussive reference products; codeine, codethyline, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine and pentoxyverine. The activity of zipeprol was superior or equal to that of all these substances, excdept codeine. The antitussive properties appeared to be due to a central action. Other properties have been demonstrated which suggest at least a supplementary mechanism in the inhibition of cough, in addition to the central action. These consisted of slight antihistamine and anticholinergic properties, marked local-anesthetic potency and bronchospasmolytic activity. This latter property was demonstrated by the inhibition of histamine and serotonin induced bronchospasm in the guinea-pig. In vitro, using human sputum, zipeprol had a mucolytic action, shown by a decrease in sputum vis viscosity and lysis of DNA and AMPS fibrils. In the dog, at high doses, zipeprol unlike codeine, did not inhibit central stimulation of respiration by hypercapnia, in addition no modification of ventilatory dynamics or blood gases was seen. On the basis of these results, zipeprol can be considered as possessing no respiratory depressant effect even in the upper ranges of its antitussive doses.",
      "Properties of the laryngeal chemoreflex in neonatal piglets. Cardiorespiratory reflex responses to laryngeal chemoreceptor stimulation were studied in 62 piglets of both sexes varying in age from 1 to 79 days. The distal trachea was cannulated to provide a free airway and the proximal end used to introduce fluids into the laryngeal area. Introduction of either water or milk produced apnea, bradycardia, and hypertension. Swab application of test fluids to the laryngeal epithelium produced similar responses. The reflex could be interrupted by flushing the laryngeal region with saline, by cutting the superior laryngeal nerves (SLN) or by anesthetizing the laryngeal epithelium with lidocaine. Electrical stimulation of SLN elicited identical responses. Respiratory inhibition by the reflex was enhanced following central depression with chloralose and overridden by administration of the respiratory stimulant, aminophylline. The relative potency of the laryngeal reflex was estimated to be equivalent to about 40% of the dose of chloralose which produced permanent respiratory arrest. It is concluded that in circumstances where respiratory drive is reduced the laryngeal inhibitory reflex is capable of caused persistent apnea and asphyxial death in the young piglet."

In the Vertebrata the great majority of cells producing hormonal peptides belong to the APUD series and share its distinctive cytochemical and ultrastructural characteristics. According to the concept all members of the series are to be regarded as derivatives of neuroectoderm or of specialized (placodal) ectoderm. For most of the APUD cells this criterion is fulfilled in that their origin from neural tube, neural ridges or neural crest can be considered proven. Complete proof is not yet available for the APUD cells of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, and indeed much contrary evidence can be cited. Despite the latter, our embryological studies show: (1) that the hypothalamohypophyseal complex is wholly neuroectodermal; (2)that the chronology of neural crest dispersion is such that this tissue could be responsible for observed APUD cell contributions to the foregut; (3) that placodal ectoderm makes important contributions to pharyngeal pouch endocrine derivatives in birds and mammals; and (4) that the amphibian parathyroid gland is derived from the same layer of neural ectoderm as the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis. Supporting immunocytochemical studies indicate that peptides belonging to the APUD series are more widely distributed than hitherto recognized and it is concluded: (1) that the whole of peptide endocrinology is neuroendocrinology; and (2) that the APUD cells, with a few cells hitherto regarded as being outside the series, form a third (Endocrine) division of the nervous system to add to the existing Somatic and Autonomic divisions.",
      "The functional anatomy of the mantle complex and columellar muscle of tectibranch molluscs (Gastropoda: Opisthobranchia), and its bearing on the evolution of opisthobranch organization. An account is given of the anatomy of a series of opisthobranch molluscs principally to assess the change in importance and functioning of the mantle cavity and columellar muscle throughout the transition from prosobranch to opisthobranch organization. Intermediate steps are represented by living tectibranchs, of which Philine and Scaphander are investigated in detail, Acteon, Bulla, Haminoea, Akera, Aglaja and Gastropteron more briefly. Though an opisthobranch, Acteon has an organization typical of a monotocardian prosobranch; the remainder show trends affecting the shell and visceral mass, mantle cavity and head-foot, which resulted finally in the production of nudibranch types. It is confirmed that the adaptations exhibited by primitive tectibranchs relate to the assumption of a burrowing mode of life. Initial changes were the reduction of the nuchal area and sealing of the mantle cavity anteriorly so that it opened on the right, where it became restricted, the first perhaps prompting the sealing. A broadening and an anterior elongation of the head-foot produced a wedge to facilitate burrowing. Change in disposition of the mantle edge, incurred by differential growth, produced an involute shell with a large body whorl, alignment changing from erect to horizontal. The resultant streamlining eased infaunal progression; no vertical insinking of the viscera was involved. Subsequently the shell became reduced and finally lost. A section of the mantle edge enlarged to produce a posterior mantle lobe upon which sit both the shell and viscera, and which later became redundant as posterior elongation of the head-foot produced a slug-like form, the viscera being incorporated within the head-foot. As the nuchal area became reduced, mechanical needs prompted alteration to both the form and attachment of the columellar muscle. In Acteon the muscle is like that of a prosobranch, but the proximal region has broadened, a change of proportion required by primitive tectibranchs in order to support the floor of the mantle cavity formed from the section of mantle skirt which in prosobranchs lies on the right. This was followed by reduction and re-alignment of the entire muscle along an anteroposterior axis as emphasis changed from the muscle effecting retraction into a shell to producing contorsions of the head-foot. The shell, similarly reduced, instead of providing anchorage, became itself anchored by additional anterior and posterior attachment zones with, in more advanced forms, dorsoventral muscles of the body wall rather than longitudinal muscles fastening to the former. Importance was placed on the mutual stabilization of constituent parts of the posterior body region. Re-alignments of the muscle induced breaking up of the longitudinal muscle sheet of the head-foot to produce muscle tracts, best exhibited in those tectibranchs which swim; they are derived from both the columellar muscle and intrinsic body wall muscles...",

Arterial, metatarsal venous, and femoral venous blood gases were drawn and analyzed for arteriovenous oxygen and carbon dioxide differences. Measurements were repeated following extensive ligation of veins and after subsequent alpha-receptor blockade with Dibenzyline. Findings indicated that ligation of extremity veins resulted in an active increase in total limb resistance upstream from the ligation, and an increase in volume of the limb. Following alpha-adrenergic blockade with Dibenzyline, limb volume increased and oxygen extraction decreased below control levels. The reflex constriction following ligation of veins protected against the detrimental effect of excessive accumulation of fluid in tissue spaces."

Attempts were made to estimate peripheral T-lymphocytes in rabbits by their ability to form rosettes with sheep, human, guinea-pig, rat, mouse and chicken RBC. The reaction was studied under different conditions of pH and temperature. The test was also carried out in the presence or absence of glutaraldehyde. With sheep RBC, lymphocytes from 2 of the 5 rabbits studied formed rosettes to the extent of 1.5% in the system containing glutaraldehyde. These results however were not reproducible when studied after a week. The RBCs from other species, under similar experimental conditions, did not give rise to rosettes. The test carried out at pH 6.8 and pH 7.2 showed up to 4 and 8% rosettes respectively with rat RBCs, while RBCs of no other species showed rosettes.

      "Evidence for stem cell function of resting bone marrow lymphocytes identified by the complete 3H-thymidine labelling method. Resting bone marrow lymphocytes, recongised as small lymphocytes by light microscopy, were labelled by the complete 3H-thymidine labelling technique, enriched by fractionation on a discontinuous albumin gradient and investigated for their stem cell properties by culture in diffusion chambers. Fraction 3, with the highest enrichment of labelled small lymphocytes and slight enrichment of other labelled cells (reticulum and endothelial cells), produced substantial growth, in contrast to fraction 4, with no enrichment of these cells. The number of labelled small lymphocytes per chamber in fraction 3 remained constant or tended to increase. This is assumed to be an indication of some degree of self-replication in the small lymphocyte population. Since, however, their labelling intensity decreased only slowly, it must be further concluded that part of the labelled small lymphocyte population probably remained resting. Some labelled transitional and blast cells appeared before the development of recognisable myelopoietic and erythropoietic precursors and of megakaryocytes, in agreement with the concept that small lymphocytes transfrom to transitional cells during the developmetn of normal haempopiesis.",

An account is given of the anatomy of a series of opisthobranch molluscs principally to assess the change in importance and functioning of the mantle cavity and columellar muscle throughout the transition from prosobranch to opisthobranch organization. Intermediate steps are represented by living tectibranchs, of which Philine and Scaphander are investigated in detail, Acteon, Bulla, Haminoea, Akera, Aglaja and Gastropteron more briefly. Though an opisthobranch, Acteon has an organization typical of a monotocardian prosobranch; the remainder show trends affecting the shell and visceral mass, mantle cavity and head-foot, which resulted finally in the production of nudibranch types. It is confirmed that the adaptations exhibited by primitive tectibranchs relate to the assumption of a burrowing mode of life. Initial changes were the reduction of the nuchal area and sealing of the mantle cavity anteriorly so that it opened on the right, where it became restricted, the first perhaps prompting the sealing. A broadening and an anterior elongation of the head-foot produced a wedge to facilitate burrowing. Change in disposition of the mantle edge, incurred by differential growth, produced an involute shell with a large body whorl, alignment changing from erect to horizontal. The resultant streamlining eased infaunal progression; no vertical insinking of the viscera was involved. Subsequently the shell became reduced and finally lost. A section of the mantle edge enlarged to produce a posterior mantle lobe upon which sit both the shell and viscera, and which later became redundant as posterior elongation of the head-foot produced a slug-like form, the viscera being incorporated within the head-foot. As the nuchal area became reduced, mechanical needs prompted alteration to both the form and attachment of the columellar muscle. In Acteon the muscle is like that of a prosobranch, but the proximal region has broadened, a change of proportion required by primitive tectibranchs in order to support the floor of the mantle cavity formed from the section of mantle skirt which in prosobranchs lies on the right. This was followed by reduction and re-alignment of the entire muscle along an anteroposterior axis as emphasis changed from the muscle effecting retraction into a shell to producing contorsions of the head-foot. The shell, similarly reduced, instead of providing anchorage, became itself anchored by additional anterior and posterior attachment zones with, in more advanced forms, dorsoventral muscles of the body wall rather than longitudinal muscles fastening to the former. Importance was placed on the mutual stabilization of constituent parts of the posterior body region. Re-alignments of the muscle induced breaking up of the longitudinal muscle sheet of the head-foot to produce muscle tracts, best exhibited in those tectibranchs which swim; they are derived from both the columellar muscle and intrinsic body wall muscles...",

These interventions lead to no result, irrespective of the time of the operation or the surgical technique. On the basis of the data of the literature and their material the authors came to the conclusion that since the alteration of the optic nerve has been histologically observed not only in the area of the optic nerve, but also in the free intracranial and intraorbital sector, this was the cause of the failure.

      "Appearance of tyrosine hydroxylase, aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase, dopamine beta-hydroxylase and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase during the ontogenesis of the adrenal medulla: an immunohistochemical study in the rat.

In the prenatal stages the medullary blastema and an adjacent part of the primitive sympathetic trunk were also investigated. Tissues were fixed in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). Cryostat sections (10 micron in thickness) were stained by the indirect immunofluorescence technique. Rabbit antibodies to TH (isolated from human pheochromocytoma), DDC, DBH and PNMT (the latter three isolated from bovine adrenal medulla) were used. Sections incubated with serum of non-immunized rabbits were used as controls. In the adult adrenal medulla, two cell types can be distinguished. One cell type contains only TH, DDC and DBH. The other cell type contains PNMT in addition. It is concluded that these cells correspond to the noradrenaline-(NA-) and adrenaline- (A-)storing cells respectively. In all prenatal stages TH, DDC and DBH are found in the primitive sympathetic trunk, in the medullary blastema, and in the medullary cells which have migrated into the cortical \"anlage\". PNMT is observed for the first time on the 18th day. Moreover, PNMT could only be demonstrated inside the adrenal gland. From these observations it is concluded that the capacity to synthesize NA is developed even before the \"medullary\" cells have reached the cortical \"anlage\". On the contrary, the capacity to synthesize A seems to be acquired only after this contact is established. The hypothesis is put forward that this phenomenon might indicate the induction of PNMT by glucocorticoids secreted by the fetal cortex.",

The hypoxic responses were dilatation of arteries and no change in the veins in both innervated and surgically denervated wings. Hypercapnia resulted in artery dilatation in innervated wings. Hypercapnia resulted in artery dilatation in innervated wings and constriction in denervated wings. The veins constricted in both innervated and denervated wings during the hypercapnia period.

Prostaglandin F2alpha (PG F2alpha) was administered to pregnant women at a dosage of 50 microng or 100 microng by extraovular route around the expected time of childbirth in order to induce labor. (1) PG F2alpha 50 microng or 100 microng dissolved in 10 ml of physiological saline solution was infused by extraovular administration through the cervical canal of the uterus with the use of Nelaton catheter No. 9. The catheter was then immediately withdrawn and the patient allowed to return home. (2) Instilation of 10ml of physiological saline solution was carried out for control purposes. (3) Those who reported labor contractions within 24 hours after the infusion were regarded as cases of excellent response, and those who reported labor contractions more than 24 hours after the infusion, or those who showed dilatation and improvement in effacement of the uterine cervical canal though without the occurrence of labor contractions were deemed to be cases of good response. The overall positive response rate (excellent plus good) was 78.9% for primiparae and 85.7% for multiparae in the group receiving 50 microng and 89.5% for primiparae and 100% for multiparae in the group receiving 100 microng. (4) Labor contraction were induced at a rate of almost 100% in those who showed dilatation of the cervical canal of the uterus to the extent of 3 cm or more and effacement to the extent of 50% or more. (5) It is advisable to perform reinfusion of PG F2alpha or instilation of PG F2alpha as a post-treatment in patients with good responses.

By contrast, samples taken from the superficial portion of the masseter demonstrated several unusual characteristics: these included a striking inequality of muscle fibre size in that the Type II fibres were much smaller than those of Type I but exceeded the latter in total number. This part of the muscle also contained, in 6 out of 10 samples, substantial numbers of intermediate fibres identified by myofibrillar ATPase staining.

An ATPase stimulated by HCO -  ions and other oxybases and inhibited by SCN- has been found in main excretory duct of rat submaxillary gland, a tissue, capable of actively secreting HCO - 3 ions. No such ATPase was found in the rabbit duct, which normally does not secrete HCO - 3. The HCO - 3 ATPase was localized in the plasma membrane fraction of the homogenate, as evidenced by the marker 5'-nucleotidase. The activities of the HCO - 3 ATPase increased in metabolic alkalosis and decreased in metabolic acidosis in parallel to secretion of HCO - 3 and K+ ions by the duct epithelium. These findings provide further evidence that the membrane-bound HCO - 3 ATPase is involved in active H+/HCO - 3 transport.",
      "Effect of the acid secretory state on intramural pH of rabbit gastric mucosa. Intramural pH  of the gastric mucosa was measured using a microelectrode technique in rabbit gastric pouches under different secretory conditions and luminal acidity. Exposure of spontaneously secreting or metiamide-treated fundic pouches to a relatively high concentration of luminal acid. HCl 120 mM, for 60 min, led to a marked net loss of luminal H+ which was associated with a significant decrease in the intramural pH (7.28 +/- 0.09 to 6.88 +/- 0.10 and 7.23 +/- 0.07 to 6.99 +/- 0.09, respectively). A linear relationship was observed between the rates of net disappearance of luminal acid and the intramural pH. All 10 spontaneously secreting and five metiamide-treated pouches had superficial mucosal erosions. In contrast, when fundic pouches were exposed to luminal acid in histamine-treated animals, the net loss of luminal H+ was negligible and the intramural pH remained at its base-line level (7.25 +/- 0.07). Histamine stimulation without acid in the lumen caused a small but insignificant increase in the intramural pH (7.27 +/- 0.03 to 7.39 +/- 0.05). Only three of the eight histamine-treated fundic pouches had lesions. In the antral pouches the intramural pH changes in response to exposure to luminal acid were smaller and histamine treatment did not influence the intramural pH. None of the antral pouches had lesions. The results suggest that acidification of the tissue by the diffusion of luminal acid may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of acute gastric ulceration. The acid secretory state of the gastric mucosa can significantly influence the acid-base balance in the mucosa and thus modify its response to acid diffusing from the lumen. Histamine stimulation protected the gastric mucosa by improving its buffering capacity and/or otherwise decreasing the diffusion of H+ from the lumen into the mucosa."

Calcium inward and potassium outward currents were studied on internally dialysed isolated neurons of the snail Helix pomatia. Different sensitivity of the corresponding channels to changes in external pH was found. This difference was used for separation of their activation regions on the potential axis so that the characteristics of the inward and outward currents could be studied with minimal overlap. It is shown that the outward current channels possess a definite permeability to Tris ions (PTris :PK=0.05). This explains the impossibility to switch off this current by substituting Tris for internal potassium. The channels for the inward calcium current inactivate slowly with a first order kinetic; their instantaneous current-voltage characteristic reveals considerable Goldman-type rectification. The selectivity of the calcium channels to other bivallent cations is Ba:Sr:Ca:Mg=2.8:2.6:1.0:0.2.",
      "[The pH dependence of kinetic parameters of Penicillium brevicompactum RNAase]. The effect of pH on the kinetic parameters (Km and Ki) for extracellular acid Penicillium brevicompactum RNAse (pH max 4.7+/-0.1), non-specific to the chemical nature of nucleic bases, was studied. The pKm--pH dependence curve showed bends within the following intervals of pH: 3.5--4.0 and 5.6--6.0 (upward side concavity) and 6.2--6.8 (downward side concavity). The pKi--pH dependence for adenosine-3'-monophosphate as an inhibitor is identical to the pH dependence on pKm for the substrate. On the other hand, the pKi--pH dependence curves obtained for the base-free inhibitors (ribose-5'-monophosphate, or phosphate (adenosine) show no bends within the pH intervals of 3.0--4.0 and 5.6--7.0 respectively.

      "Phosphofructokinase. III. Correlation of the regulatory kinetic and molecular properties of the rabbit muscle enzyme. It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation."

Unilateral intranigral infusion of kainic acid (1.5 microgram) produced neuronal loss in the lateral two-thirds of the nigra while sparing axons en passage. Fink-Heimer silver impregnation revealed dense terminal degeneration in the nigra itself (both in the compacta and in the reticulata) and in areas of non-dopaminergic nigral projection such as the ventromedial (VM) nucleus of the thalamus, the superior colliculus and the reticular formation; only spare terminal degeneration was found in areas of dopaminergic projection such as the caudate and septum. In order to clarify the nature of the transmitter of the nigrothalamic and nigrocollicular neurons, the activity of glutamic decarboxylase (GAD), the marker of cholinergic neurons, was measured in the VM and ventrobasal (VB) thalamus and in the nigra of each side, 7 days after unilateral intranigral injection of kainic acid. GAD activity was reduced significantly in the VM-thalamus (-33%), in the superior colliculus (-40%) and in the substantia nigra (-18%) but not in the VB-thalamus of the lesioned side. CAT remained unchanged in these areas. Similar results were obtained in the thalamus and in the superior colliculus after electrocoagulative lesions of the nigra. The results indicate the existence of a nigrothalamic and of a nigrocollicular GABAergic pathway. This projection might play an important role in motor coordination and gaze control.",

These interventions lead to no result, irrespective of the time of the operation or the surgical technique. On the basis of the data of the literature and their material the authors came to the conclusion that since the alteration of the optic nerve has been histologically observed not only in the area of the optic nerve, but also in the free intracranial and intraorbital sector, this was the cause of the failure. The authors' five cases are demonstrated with light and electron microscopic examinations.",
      "An automated superfusion technique for measuring circular muscle contraction. Effects of serotonin on intra- and extracranial arteries. A new in vitro technique is described and its advantages are demonstrated: \"true\" circular contraction is measured; arteries are in cascade, permitting comparison of intra- and extracranial arteries from the same animal; the mechanical influences on contractility are reduced; long-lasting experiments of up to 50 h can be performed; the procedure is fully automated. The maximal effect of an agonist was not only markedly modified during the first 2--4 h after fixing the arteries in the apparatus but also slightly during the next 3--4 h. After the initial stabilization period, the arterial response to an agonist remained highly reproducible for 24--48 h (standard deviation not exceeding 7%). This was demonstrated in all the types of arteries tested.

      "Extrinsic neural influences on gastrointestinal motility. The gastrointestinal tract is capable of carrying on all its major functions after all extrinsic nerves have been cut. This automaticity is due to the local nervous mechanisms in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract and the inherent properties of the smooth muscles in its walls, and gastrointestinal hormones. All levels of the central nervous system have been shown, by stimulation and ablation studies, to influence the motility of the entire gastrointestinal tract. Throughout many cerebral areas there are loci which, on stimulation, exert both inhibitory, and less often, excitatory influence on gastrointestinal motility. These influences are mediated by sympathetic and parasympathetic visceral efferent nerves, as well as humoral agents from the neurohypophysis. Thus, they impose an influence of higher control on the automatically efficient intrinsic motility. They are guided by information received from visceral, cranial, and somatic afferents, as well as intracerebral, or psychic inputs. Under normal circumstances they only influence gastrointestinal activity as will best afford the optimal functioning of a performance done automatically with efficiency and finesse."

The anatomy of three neurosecretory cell types in the central nervous system (c.n.s.) of the gastropod mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis (L.)- the Dark Green Cells, Yellow Cells and Yellow-green Cells-has been studied by using bright and dark field illumination of material stained for neurosecretion by the Alcian Blue-Alcian Yellow technique. The neuronal geometry of single and groups of neurosecretory cells of the various types has been reconstructed from serial sections, and the likely destination of most of their processes has been determined. Dark Green Cells are monopolar, occur exclusively within the central nervous system (c.n.s.), have few or no branches terminating in neuropile, and send axons to the surface of the pleuro-parietal and pleuro-cerebral connectives. The majority of Dark Green Cell axons however (80-85%), project down nerves which innervate ventral and anterior parts of the head-foot, the neck and the mantle. Dark Green Cell axons can be found in small nerves throughout these areas, and may terminate in a find plexus of axons on the surfaces of the nerves. Since previous experimental work has shown that the Dark Green Cells are involved in osmotic or ionic regulation, these results suggest that the target organ of the Dark Green Cells may be the skin. Yellow Cells occur both within and outside the c.n.s. They are usually monopolar, but can be bipolar. They have several axons which normally arise separately from a single pole of the cell body, or close to it. One or more processes leave the cell proximal to the point where separate axons arise, and may run unbranched for some distance through neuropile before terminating in fine brances and blobs of various sizes. These branches may release hormone inside the c.n.s. Yellow-green Cells are mono-, bi- or multi-polar, and like the Yellow Cells are found both within and outside the c.n.s. Some Yellow-green Cells, though not all, have projections which terminate in neuropile in fine branches and blobs. Yellow-green Cell bodies which occur in nerves can project back along the nerve into the c.n.s. The axons of Yellow Cells and Yellow-green Cells project to release sites in various ways. Some project into the connective tissue shealth of the c.n.s., which serves as a neurohaemal organ, either directly through the surface of a ganglion, or from the pleuro-cerebral or pleuro-parietal connectives. Other axons leave the c.n.s. via nerves leaving the left and right parietal and visceral ganglia; projections into the intestinal, anal, and internal right parietal nerves being most numerous. Axons which may be from either, or both Yellow Cells and Yellow-green Cells, can be found along the entire unbranched lengths of these nerves, and in subsequent branches which innervate organs lying in the anterior turn of the shell.

      "Kainic acid and synaptic transmission in the stellate ganglion of the squid. Kainate, a conformational analogue of glutamate, blocks synaptic transmission across the giant synapse of the squid. In the presence of blocking doses of kainate, impulses continue to propagate into the nerve terminal, but action potentials are slightly reduced in size and the subsequent hyperpolarization is greatly diminished. Kainate depolarizes the postsynaptic axon. Since the depolarizing action of kainate is confined to the postsynaptic membrane, it appears that kainate can combine with the receptors which are normally activated by the transmitter. This results in a diminished effect of the transmitter released by a presynaptic nerve impulse.",
      "Dendro-dendritic and reciprocal synapses in the primate motor cortex. Dendro-dendritic synapses have been observed infrequently in the deep layers of the motor cortex.

The ultrastructure of the dendro-dendritic synapse itself shows the typical arrangement of presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane densities, often with presynaptic dense projections, and the membrane specialization is of the symmetrical type. There is the usual cleft containing electron-dense material between the presynaptic and postsynaptic profiles. The synaptic vesicles occur in a small cluster confined to a region close to the presynaptic membrane specialization; some of the vesicles are flattened and were shown by tilt analysis to be of the discoid type. Two examples were found of reciprocal dendro-dendritic synapses, both components being of the symmetrical type.

By contrast, samples taken from the superficial portion of the masseter demonstrated several unusual characteristics: these included a striking inequality of muscle fibre size in that the Type II fibres were much smaller than those of Type I but exceeded the latter in total number. This part of the muscle also contained, in 6 out of 10 samples, substantial numbers of intermediate fibres identified by myofibrillar ATPase staining.

Lesions were noted in 7.0 and 4.4% of mandible pairs collected from the Western Arctic caribou herd of northwestern Alaska in 1959-61 and 1975-77, respectively. The prevalence of mandibular lesions in the 1959-61 collection is believed to be the highest reported in wild caribou herds of North America. The frequency of occurrence of mandibular lesions was highest in caribou 7 years of age and older, and there was a higher prevalence in adult males than in adult females. Trauma, dental abscesses, and periodontal disease were the probably cause of most lesions. Pathogenic bacteria were not isolated from mandibular lesions from an 11 year-old female. Thirty-three of 98 (33.7%) mandibles with lesions were missing one tooth, while ten (10.2%) were missing more than one tooth. The first molar (M1) was the most common tooth lost in association with lesions, although the loss of two or more teeth was more common among premolars than among molars."

Mean insulin concentration in solitary adenomas and in adenomas of patients with adenomatosis was higher than in control pancreases; however, in all but 1 patient the insulin concentration in neoplastic islet tissue was lower than in islet tissue of control pancreas, assuming islet volume is 1% of pancreas. The percentage of proinsulin was elevated in 52% of tumors. Adenoma insulin content correlated with increments of plasma insulin after tolbutamide administration. Insulin and proinsulin concentrations in pancreas uninvolved by tumor were not suppressed. Fasting plasma glucagon was elevated in patients with islet cell adenomatosis and in patients with islet cell carcinoma some of whom had multiple endocrine adenomatosis. The mean concentration of glucagon in tumors was lower than in control pancreases. Elevated concentration of gastrin was found in some adenomas. The data indicate: 1) insulin-secreting islet cell tumors have decreased storage capacity for insulin, 2) elevated concentration of proinsulin in tumors may be due to decreased capacity to store insulin and in some to decreased conversion of proinsulin to insulin as well, 3) tolbutamide stimulates the exaggerated release of a relatively constant fraction of insulin stored in adenomas. 4) solitary adenomas may contain excess amounts of pancreatic hormones in addition to insulin, 5) elevated plasma glucagon in patients with organic hyperinsulinism may indicate malignancy, microadenomatosis or multiple endocrine adenoma syndrome, and 6) chronic hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia due to adenoma do not suppress insulin and proinsulin content of uninvolved pancreas.",

Bile composition and secretion were studied in tow elasmobranch species, Squalus acanthias (spiny dogfish shark) and Raja erinacea (small skate), after ligation of the common duct and insertion of cannulas into the gallbladder lumen. Fish were then allowed to swim freely in large pools and bile was collected in balloons attached to the externalized cannulas. Both species secreted bile for periods of 4-7 days at a maximum rate of 1.77 +/- .89 ml/kg per 24 h in Squalus acanthias and 2.66 +/- .89 ml/kg per 24 h in Raja erinacea. Comparison of the composition of cannula and gallbladder bile indicated that hepatic bile could be collected by this technique in both species without effective contact with gallbladder epithelium. The low concentrations of HCO3- and CL- and the gigh bile salt levels in dogfish gallbladder bile indicate that mechanisms for concentration and acidification of bile in the gallbladder developed early in vertebrate evolution. These results indicate that gallbladder cannulation in free-swimming elasmobranchs is a useful technique for the study of bile secretory and excretory function in marine species."

      "The electron microscopy of \"fibrinoid necrosis\" in pulmonary arteries. Fibrinoid necrosis was induced in the pulmonary arteries of five male Wistar albino rats by feeding them on a diet adulterated by the addition of 0.07% ground Crotalaria spectabilis seeds by weight. Electron microscopy of the arteries affected by the process showed fibrin in the thrombus occluding their lumens and in the arterial intima, held up from further penetration of the media by the inner elastic lamina. Naturally occurring gaps in this lamina were found, and it is postulated that they determine the characteristic histological configuration of fibrinous vasculosis. The smooth muscle cells of the media of the pulmonary veins showed clear evaginations, devoid of myofilaments and organells, indicative of sustained constriction compatible with viability of the cells. In contrast, the smooth muscle cells of the media of the pulmonary arteries showed loss of myofilaments leading to frank necrosis. Other cells seen in the media include fibrocytes and \"vasoformative reserve cells.\" The authors consider that the latter have considerable and varied potential. Once liberated during the process of fibrinoid necrosis in the arterial media they may play an important part in pulmonary vascular pathology as, for example, in the formation of the plexiform lesion.",
      "Is a left ventricular vent necessary during cardiopulmonary bypass? This study evaluated the coronary flow and the internal diameter, pressure, and metabolism of the left ventricle using four different cardiopulmonary bypass techniques. Conditioned dogs underwent a 30-minute stabilizing period on cardiopulmonary bypass with a beating, empty heart (normothermia and a flow of 80 ml/kg/min). They were then fibrillated and subjected to four experiments: Group A (7 dogs)--left ventricular vent, caval tapes open; group B (7 dogs)--left ventricular vent, caval tapes closed; group C (7 dogs)--no vent, caval tapes open; group D (4 dogs)--no vent, caval tapes closed. There was no major difference in any of these variables among Groups A and B (both ventricles vented). Group D (no vent, tapes closed) had significantly increased wall tension, decreased coronary flow, decreased subendocardiac flow, and ischemia. In contrast, Group C dogs (no vent, tapes open) had only a slight increase in left ventricular diameter and pressure, with no change from Group A and B dogs in coronary flow, lactate extraction, hydrogen ion production, or potassium difference. Therefore, venting the fibrillating ventricle, either with or without snaring of the caval tapes, is probably the best method to use during the distal anastomosis in a coronary artery bypass operation. However, if a vent is not used, the caval tapes should be left open to allow complete diversion of the venous blood and decompression of the left ventricle."

      "The functional anatomy of the mantle complex and columellar muscle of tectibranch molluscs (Gastropoda: Opisthobranchia), and its bearing on the evolution of opisthobranch organization. An account is given of the anatomy of a series of opisthobranch molluscs principally to assess the change in importance and functioning of the mantle cavity and columellar muscle throughout the transition from prosobranch to opisthobranch organization. Intermediate steps are represented by living tectibranchs, of which Philine and Scaphander are investigated in detail, Acteon, Bulla, Haminoea, Akera, Aglaja and Gastropteron more briefly. Though an opisthobranch, Acteon has an organization typical of a monotocardian prosobranch; the remainder show trends affecting the shell and visceral mass, mantle cavity and head-foot, which resulted finally in the production of nudibranch types. It is confirmed that the adaptations exhibited by primitive tectibranchs relate to the assumption of a burrowing mode of life. Initial changes were the reduction of the nuchal area and sealing of the mantle cavity anteriorly so that it opened on the right, where it became restricted, the first perhaps prompting the sealing. A broadening and an anterior elongation of the head-foot produced a wedge to facilitate burrowing. Change in disposition of the mantle edge, incurred by differential growth, produced an involute shell with a large body whorl, alignment changing from erect to horizontal. The resultant streamlining eased infaunal progression; no vertical insinking of the viscera was involved. Subsequently the shell became reduced and finally lost. A section of the mantle edge enlarged to produce a posterior mantle lobe upon which sit both the shell and viscera, and which later became redundant as posterior elongation of the head-foot produced a slug-like form, the viscera being incorporated within the head-foot. As the nuchal area became reduced, mechanical needs prompted alteration to both the form and attachment of the columellar muscle. In Acteon the muscle is like that of a prosobranch, but the proximal region has broadened, a change of proportion required by primitive tectibranchs in order to support the floor of the mantle cavity formed from the section of mantle skirt which in prosobranchs lies on the right. This was followed by reduction and re-alignment of the entire muscle along an anteroposterior axis as emphasis changed from the muscle effecting retraction into a shell to producing contorsions of the head-foot. The shell, similarly reduced, instead of providing anchorage, became itself anchored by additional anterior and posterior attachment zones with, in more advanced forms, dorsoventral muscles of the body wall rather than longitudinal muscles fastening to the former. Importance was placed on the mutual stabilization of constituent parts of the posterior body region. Re-alignments of the muscle induced breaking up of the longitudinal muscle sheet of the head-foot to produce muscle tracts, best exhibited in those tectibranchs which swim; they are derived from both the columellar muscle and intrinsic body wall muscles...",
      "The American Cleft Palate Association: its first 36 years. History involves memory, and sometimes memory is faulty. History requires documentation, and sometimes documents cannot be found. History demands winnowing, and sometimes the wheat and the chaff cannot be completely separated. History is an assembly of details, and details may become burdensome. History is a challenge, to which the historian tries to respond. Surely, earlier Historians of the American Cleft Palate Association must have encountered this challenge. The present Historian acknowledges the work of her predecessors: George H. Foster, W. J. Robinson, and William Harkins from dentistry and Gretchen M. Phair and Asa J. Berlin from speech pathology. In preparing this review of events that took place from 1943 to 1978, in the United States and in other countries, during times of war and times of relative peace, through difficulties and accomplishments, I have attempted to be as accurate as possible. If I have distorted facts and if I have omitted people and happenings that should have been included, I have not done so intentionally. As Historian of the American Cleft Palate Association, I have appreciated the opportunity to learn about the organization and the people, past and present, who have built and maintained it. Thank you for giving me this assignment."

      "[Survived brain infarction in old age - clinical and morphological findings. part I: extracranial stenoses of carotis arteries (author's transl)]. By clinical and post mortem findings we searched for the risk factors, important for brain infarctions in people of nearly 80 years. We were especially interested in the conditions of the extracranial vessels such as the carotid arteries and the murmurs at this point. The number of arterial stenoses in this region, ascertained in younger people is similar in old age. Besides of others factors, caused by old age, the many cases of multiple extracranial stenoses are probably responsible for the overproportional big brain infarctions in this series. In nearly 50% of all stenoses we heard vascular murmurs, mostly in both of the carotid arteries. Despite of some uncertainly of the clinical importance - just in old age many cardiac murmurs of the ejection type with tendency to transmission have been heard - they should give rise to investigate carefully the region of the neck in symptomatic patients.",
      "Localization of hypophysiotropic neurohormones by assay of sections from various brain areas. The results of studies of the localization of the hypothalamic hypophysiotropic factors based on their direct determination in sections or nuclear punches are described. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone was found in high concentrations in the median eminence-arcuate nucleus complex, in lower concentrations in the mediobasal zone of the preoptic area. In addition to these hypothalamic sites, it is present in all four periventricular organs, especially in the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis. Thyrotropin releasing hormone has a widespread distribution. High concentrations are in the median eminence, arcuate nucleus, dorsomedial nucleus, and anterior part of the ventromedial nucleus. Lower concentrations are in several other structures of the hypothalamus, preoptic area and septum, and low but measurable quantities are found in most of the structures of the brain. Somatostatin is also present in most structures of the central nervous system, with highest concentrations in the median eminence, arcuate nucleus, ventromedial nucleus and periventricular nucleus. There are indications that the ventromedial nucleus or its immediate vicinity contains growth hormone releasing factor. Prolactin releasing activity was present in the median eminence and mediobasal parts of the anterior hypothalamus, whereas prolactin inhibitory activity was in the dorsolateral parts of the anterior hypothalamus and/or preoptic area."

      "Actions of iontophoretic phenytoin and medazepam on hippocampal neurons. In rats anesthetized with methoxyflurane, phenytoin (DPH) and medazepam (MDZ) were administered iontophoretically to pyramidal and granule cells discharging spontaneously or being driven by acetylcholine or glutamic acid. The objectives were to determine if: 1) these anticonvulsant agents exert direct effects on the rates of discharge of hippocampal neurons; 2) similarities exist between responses elicited by DPH and MDZ; and 3) pyramidal and granule cells differ in their responsiveness to the drugs. The firing rates of 38% of spontaneously active neurons were reduced by iontophoretic DPH. The incidence of depression by DPH depended upon the pretest discharge rates of the cells. Only 5% of cells with spontaneous rates less than 12/sec were depressed by DPH, but 80% with rates faster than 12/sec were inhibited. MDZ depressed 79% of spontaneously firing neurons regardless of pretest discharge rate. A majority of neurons whose firing rates were facilitated by either acetylcholine or glutamate were depressed by DPH or MDZ ejected iontophoretically. Pyramidal and granule cells responded similarly to putative transmitters, but differentially to the drugs. MDZ depressed a much greater proportion of spontaneously active granule cells then DPH. Phenytoin and MDZ differed with regard to the incidence of depression of spontaneous discharges, inhibition of slow firing cells, the proportion of granule cells depressed, and the duration of effect. These differences may be due to potency and pharmacokinetic factors or dissimilar mechanisms of action when the compounds are applied directly to single neurons.",
      "Pipradrol enhances reinforcing properties of stimuli paired with brain stimulation. The hypothesis that a psychomotor stimulant drug (pipradrol) enhances the reinforcing effects of stimuli paired with reinforcing brain stimulation was tested using a conditioned reinforcement paradigm. Rats were trained to discriminate between two stimuli (S+ and S-) to obtain ICS in the lateral hypothalamus by pushing a panel in the presence of S+. In a subsequent preference test, ICS was no longer available, but responding on one of two novel levers now produced S+, whereas responding on the other lever produced S-. Four groups of four rats received 0, 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg pipradrol. Doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg significantly enhanced the preference for S+ over S-. These doses increased responding for S+, but had no effect on responding for S-. These results support the hypothesis tested, and suggest that pipradrol potentiates the effects of conditioned reinforcement."

It is suggested that ether exerts its depressant influence mainly by direct action on the function of the follicular cells of the thyroid. Thiobutabarbitone Sodium probably influences thyroid function especially by its antithyroid-drug effects, which have been reported by other authors.

      "Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Out of the discovery of concurrent multiple endocrine neoplasms has evolved the concept of multiple endocrine adenomatosis (MEA1 and MEA2). Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid gland is the most constant facet of MEA2 and is derived from C-cells of the neural crest. These cells, resembling parafollicular cells of lower animals, elaborate calcitonin which acts as a sensitive signal of the presence of the tumor. Ninety per cent of MCT occurs sporadically; in 10% the tumor presents as an atuosomal dominant trait. Other endocrinopathies, especially pheochromocytomas, are present in 70% of cases. The lesions are \"cold\" on iodine radioisotope scan. On microscopic examination, the appearance of amyloid is characteristic. Regional lymph node metastasis occurs early. The tumor deserves appropriate aggressive management. Surgical therapy should begin early and vigorously with the minimum procedure being total thyroidectomy. Frequent lymph node metastasis speaks for the need for regional neck dissection extended into the superior mediastinum. The search for, and the treatment of, the frequently associated endocrinopathies is essential. Pheochromocytoma must be suspected and eradicated before treatment of the thyroid tumor. A genetic workup should be included.",

Many gap junctions joined apposed supporting cells both within apposed hair and supporting cells, membrane specialization sharing the morphological characterics of both the macula adherens and zonula adherens was found. Between cells, there were short areas of parallel limiting membranes separated by a 20A intercellular space. These areas were suggestive but not characteristic of gap junctional specialization. The functional significance of the junctional specialization between cells in the organ of Corti is discussed."

In the light of the experience of the authors in an anti-cancer center, three main principles can be enumerated for this to be properly organised: the detachment of doctors from the surgical departments, a rotation in the department and a timetable for the consultations. The part played by the departments requesting help and the different secretarial offices is important. In this way one can anticipate and eliminate the improvisation which always occurs, to the detriment of the patient. Collaboration between the different departments involved is naturally indispensable. These general principles have beeen stated for at least a dozen or so years by a certain number of anaesthetists. It was quite easy to stranspose these principles and to adapt them to the organisation of the anti-cancer struggle. Such applications should be generalised."

Each ciliary sheath has several ballon-like swellings and the ciliary microtubules, arranged in the 9+2 pattern in the proximal part, are markedly disorganized distally in the swollen parts, out of which extends most of the microvilli in the vitreous layer. It is suggested that some of the microvilli may originate in vesicles that are constricted off from the surface of the pigmented sensory cells. Closely packed microvilli run in parallel in short bundles. In addition to characteristic junctions between sensory cells, junctions that are presumably synaptic and, of a new type in coelenterates, are observed between sensory cells and nerve endings.",

The average molecular size of the released proteoglycans, as assessed by fractionation on Sepharose 2B/CL and 4B/Cl, was only slightly smaller than that of the proteoglycans extracted from non-cultured cartilage with 4 M guanidine HCl. The percentage of released proteoglycans and extracted proteoglycans which formed aggregates with hyaluronic acid was approx. 25% and 75%, respectively. The results indicate that proteoglycan degradation in adult articular cartilage is initiated by a limited proteolysis of subunit core protein, with the production of non-aggregating species which diffuse readily from the tissue."

There are, in contrast, multiple binding sites of oxytocin and vasopressin to the neurophysins and large temperature dependences of the number of sites and their binding constants.

      "Some pharmacological actions of acetylsecohemicholinium. The effects of the acetylated derivative of HC-3 (acetylsecohemicholinium; AcHC-3) have been studied at cholinergic nerve terminals and compared with the effects of the parent compound. AcHC-3 blocked neuromuscular transmission in nerve-muscle preparations; it was shown to be less effective than HC-3 in producing a pre-junctional block in the rat diaphragm but was more effective than HC-3 in eliciting a post-junctional blocking effect in the chick biventer muscle. On the frog rectus abdominis muscle AcHC-3 caused a substantial potentiation of the contractures elicited by acetylcholine but did not by itself cause a contracture of the muscle. AcHC-3 inhibited the synthesis of acetylcholine by cholinergic nerve ending particles and inhibited the uptake of [14C]choline into brain synaptosomal fractions to a similar extent to HC-3. AcHC-3 was shown to be a substrate for cholinesterase enzymes although the rate of hydrolysis was much less than the rate of hydrolysis of acetylcholine. It is concluded that AcHC-3 is effective in inhibiting cholinergic transmission and this action is exerted by the open chain (seco) compound and is not due to the hydrolysis of the AcHC-3 by cholinesterases to form the active HC-3 molecule.",

When the anesthetics were compared at concentrations equivalent in terms of minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), a spectrum was observed in which halothane, methoxyflurane and isoflurane depressed the indirect twitch response at 3.5--5 MAC and the direct twitch response at 8--10 MAC. Diethyl ether and fluroxene depressed the indirect twitch response at 2--3.5 MAC and the direct twitch response at 3--6 MAC. Enflurane depressed the indirect response at 1.5--2.5 MAC and the direct response at 6--8 MAC. When the anesthetics were compared at concentrations equivalent in terms of their abilities to depress end-plate depolarization, however, all anesthetics were equipotent. Depression of the indirect twitch response occurred only when anesthetic concentrations were great enough to depress depolarization by 50 per cent."

High resolution serial photomicrography has been used to plot the axonal projection patterns between retina, lamina and medulla in the optic lobes of various insects with differing ommatidial receptor arrangements. Observations are reported on the cabbage white and skipper butterflies, the bee, locust, fly, backswimmer and waterbug. The patterns of these fibre pathways have previously eluded non-rigorous analyses primarily because of their physical dimensions but are revealed in this study to have striking precision and uniformity between species when examined at the level of individually identifiable cells. Axon bundles of the tracts between retina and lamina or lamina and medulla project between a single ommatidium and its corresponding lamina cartridge or between corresponding lamina and medulla cartridges. Lateral interweaving of axons between adjacent bundles is absent. The bundles preserve the retinotopic order within their total array, so transferring the pattern of retinulae directly upon the lamina and thence after horizontal inversion in the chiasma upon the medulla. Within the lamina neuropile on the other hand the trajectories of the individual terminals from a bundle have patterns which are species-specific, sometimes involving lateral divergences. In species with open-rhabdomere ommatidia the terminals distribute to a group of lamina cartidges with a pattern which resembles the receptor pattern in the overlying ommatidium. In species with fused-rhabdome ommatidia the terminals of a single retinula behave less interestingly and all enter the same cartridge, within which, again, each occupies a position related to its cell body position within the retinula. Long visual fibres in both eye types penetrate the lamina and terminate in the particular medulla cartridge that connects with the lamina cartridge underlying their ommatidium. The perpendicular fibre pathways therefore project the visual field exactly upon the medulla in all species while the lack of interweaving between adjacent fibre bundles precludes their involvement in lateral interactions between pathways with differing visual axes. Uniformity of these projection patterns between cell layers and species differences in retinular terminal locations in the lamina can be correlated with different modes of axon growth between and within neuropile layers during optic lobe neurogenesis. Further discussion surrounds the question of which particular receptors give rise to which type of axon, for which no clear generalization has yet emerged.",
      "[Neurologic syndromes in myocardial infarct patients during various stages of treatment]. The clinical picture of myocardial infarctions in complicated and manifold. A clinico-physiological analysis of neurological disorders gives ground to consider that in myocardial infarctions the process of irritation involves the peripheral vegetative apparatus and spinal segmental structures, as well as the hypothalmostem structures with the reticular formation, which in its turn is accompanied by disturbances of cortico-subcortical interrelationships. In patients with myocardial infarctions the vegetative disorders are of a regional character and may be expressed in symptomatology, characteristic of the stimulation of sympathetic ganglions on the left side, mainly in the stellate node.",
      "Intercellular junctions in the organ of Corti. The intercellular junctions between adjacent supporting cells and between apposed hair and supporting cells in the organ of Corti of cat and human were studied. At the endolymphatic surface, the intercellular space was closed by a series of tight junctions (zonula occludens), whereas there were no tight junctions at the basilar membrane surface of the neuroepithelium. Beneath the adlumenal zonula occludens between adjacent supporting cells, a zonula adherens (intermediate junction, \"desmosone\") was found. Many gap junctions joined apposed supporting cells both within apposed hair and supporting cells, membrane specialization sharing the morphological characterics of both the macula adherens and zonula adherens was found. Between cells, there were short areas of parallel limiting membranes separated by a 20A intercellular space. These areas were suggestive but not characteristic of gap junctional specialization. The functional significance of the junctional specialization between cells in the organ of Corti is discussed."

      "Vestibular responses in schizophrenia. In a study of vestibular responses to caloric stimulation that controlled opportunity for fixation and state of alertness, we evaluated previous findings of diminished nystagmus in schizophrenia. We failed to replicate earlier reports in these respects: (1) None of the psychotic patient groups, when compared with normal controls, showed lower response intensity, latency, or culmination time of the nystagmic response. (2) The schizophrenic groups did not manifest a prevalence of clinically significant asymmetry. We did, however, observe that chronic deteriorated schizophrenics and recent schizophrenics have significantly greater dysrhythmic responses. This diminished orderliness of nystagmus may explain previous reports of absent or diminished nystagmus in the schizophrenics. The results are not compatible with peripheral vestibular disease in schizophrenia, but they may reflect state-related phenomena consistent with disturbances in alertness, which are not necessarily voluntary or motivational in origin."

The authors describe a case of flaccid tetraplegia due to a polyneuropathy in a man aged 50 years, progressing rapidly to death from mesenteric infarction. As significant abnormalities, the hematologic examinations revealed a very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a marked leukocytosis and a positive Australia antigen in repeated controls. In spite of the clinical picture being that of a symmetrical polyneuropathy rather than that of mononeuritis multiplex, the diagnose of a collagenosis was suspected. Nevertheless steroid treatment was not given because the patient had a peptic ulcer.

Instead the nerve trunks examined (the sciatic nerve and the lumbo-sacral plexus) showed gross changes in the vasa nervorum represented by abundant perivascular cuffing and marked evidence of axonal degeneration secondary to an ischaemic damage.

The pathological findings in this fatal case of diffuse peripheral involvement were not those of classical periarteritis nodosa, but showed the picture of so-called \"allergic vasculitis\".

The steady state distribution of DMO between cells and plasma was calculated from the mean transit times of the indicator. Normal myocardial cell pH averaged 6.94 and changed by 58% of the concomitant alterations in plasma pH after infusions of acid or alkali. Myocardial ischemia induced by inflation of a balloon tip catheter in the left anterior descending coronary artery resulted in progressive decreases in cell pH to 6.59 by 1 hour. Infusions of sodium carbonate diminished intracellular acidosis. Hemodynamic studies during 4 hours of ischemia with blood pH at 7.55 to 7.60 indicated a significantly reduced left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and increased stroke volume by comparison with findings in animals given infusions of saline solution. Ventriculograms revealed improved wall motion in the ischemic segment after infusion of alkali. Precordial mapping showed a significant reduction in the number of leads with S-T segment elevation as well as in the sum of S-T segment elevations, but R wave amplitudes did not differ from those in control studies. Calculations of extracellular space, tissue water and cation content revealed a reduced gain of cell sodium ion and loss of cell potassium ion during ischemia after alkali treatment. The latter may account for the S-T segment responses, whereas enhanced ventricular performance may be related to reduced competition of hydrogen ion with calcium ion for binding sites on contractile protein.",
      "Changes in hydromineral metabolism in diarrhoeic rabbits. 2. Study of the modifications of electrolyte metabolism. The study of the equilibrium of the main electrolytes (Na+, K+, Cl-), in plasma and intestinal content and the evolution of the partial plasma (Na+, K+, Cl-) in the young rabbit suffering from diarrhoea revealed disturbances of the mineral metabolism. Mineral losses were lower in sick animals than in controls. When the reduction of ingested matter was taken into account, the ion balance showed a deficit. The apparent coefficient of digestive utlization (aCDU) of the electrolytes Na+ and K+ dropped, although the reabsorption of these ions in the last segments of the digestive tract was generally good. The pH remained normal and the proteinaemia fell, suggesting a haemodilution. This was backed up by the presence of a hyponatraemia and a hypochloraemia, but did not account for the large drop in kaliemia. On the other hand, the plasma osmotic pressure increased, very probably in association with a high uraemia. It would therefore seem that the pathogenesis of diarrhoea in the young rabbit differed from that of other known examples, such as diarrhoea in the calf and in the infant. In the young rabbit, the pathogenesis of diarrhoea resulting from coccidiosis would seem to be, as much a result of a nutritional deficiency in particular of potassium, as of a malfunctioning of the digestive tract.",

In an examination of the water spaces was an age depended decreasing of the quantity of total and of the intracellular fluid remarked.

The role of post-synaptic cells in the development of pre-synaptic cholinergic nerve terminals has been investigated in immature rat superior cervical ganglia (SCG) and adrenals employing chemical agents which prevent the normal maturation of post-synaptic cells. A marked atrophy of ganglion adrenergic neurons after guanethidine administration was accompanied by the complete failure of normal maturation of choline acetyltransferase (ChAc) activity in the presynaptic endings. However, the same treatment failed to alter the levels of ChAc in the mature ganglia despite the marked atrophy of adrenergic neurons. Administration of dexamethasone resulted in a growth retardation of ganglion neurons as well as adrenal chromaffin cells reflected by the lower levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase than those in untreated tissues. The levels of ChAc were significantly lower in the ganglia, but not in the adrenals when treatment was started immediately after birth. These results support the view that the normal synapse formation in the SCG depends on the normal maturation of adrenergic neurons, and suggest that this dependence is detectable only during a limited period of life.",
      "Motor innervation of the smooth muscle of the rat seminal vesicle. Frequency-related isovolumetric contractions of the rat seminal vesicle elicited with transmural electrical stimulation were blocked by tetrodotoxin but unaffected by hexamethonium. The postganglionic motor innervation of the rat seminal vesicle is purely excitatory and contains both an adrenergic and a cholinergic component which are excited simultaneously during transmural stimulation. Contractions elicited by adrenergic nerve stimulation were mediated by norepinephrine acting via alpha adrenoceptors, i.e., 1) responses of untreated vesicles to transmural stimulation and to exogenous norepinephrine were antagonized by phentolamine and potentiated by cocaine, 2) pretreatment of animals with reserpine or 6-hydroxydopamine produced a marked depletion of tissue norepinephrine concentration and reduced the responses to transmural stimulation to a level which resembled that of untreated organs in the presence of phentolamine, 3) the residual responses of vesicles from pretreated rats were not modified by phentolamine or cocaine, and 4) responses to tyramine in untreated organs were antagonized by phentolamine but not by cocaine and were observed in organs from reserpine-pretreated rats only after repletion with exogenous norepinephrine. Responses elicited by cholinergic nerve stimulation were mediated by acetylcholine through muscarinic receptors, i.e., 1) responses of untreated vesicles to transmural stimulation and to exogenous acetylcholine were antagonized by atropine, 2) the residual responses to transmural stimulation of vesicles from animals pretreated with reserpine of 6-hydroxydopamine were nearly abolished by atropine and 3) physostigmine potentiated and prolonged the responses of organs from untreated and reserpine-pretreatd animals to transmural stimulation; these effects of physostigmine were abolished by atropine.",
      "Characterization of receptors on postganglionic cholinergic neurons in the guinea-pig isolated ileum. Dopamine, apomorphine, noradrenaline and isoprenaline reduced the response of the isolated guinea-pig ileum to exogenous acetylcholine by a maximum of 40%. Propranolol reversed this inhibition whilst phentolamine and pimozide were ineffective, suggesting that the drugs were acting on a post-synaptic beta-adrenoceptor. The same agonists were more effective as inhibitors of the response to transmural electrical stimulation of the ileum, lower doses producing almost complete inhibition. This inhibition was partially antagonized by phentolamine, pimozide and propranolol. Clonidine proved to be the most potent inhibitor of the response to transmural electrical stimulation, whilst phenylephrine was ineffective. pA2 determinations showed that phentolamine was a potent antagonist of clonidine but a weak antagonist of apomorphine whilst for pimozide the opposite was true. The results suggest that there are two populations of prejunctional receptors on the cholinergic nerves innervating the smooth muscle of the guinea-pig ileum. One receptor is similar to a classical prejunctional alpha-adrenoceptor and the other resembles a central dopamine receptor."

      "Regulation of the bacterial microflora of the vagina in cyclic female rats. The bacterial microflora was examined in the vagina of cyclic female rats kept under normal laboratory conditions. Large variations occurred during the cycle with high numbers of bacteria (10(5)-10(8) per vagina) during proestrus and estrus and low numbers (10(1)-10(4) per vagina) during the diestrus period. Histological analysis of in situ vaginal tissue and transplanted vaginal tissue revealed an association of high bacterial numbers with the presence of large amounts of cellular debris in the vaginal lumen during the period of epithelial keratinization. Absence of phagocytosis in leucocytes at mestestrus suggested that leucocytes did not play an active role in reduction of bacterial numbers between estrus and metestrus. Accurate measurement of the pH in the vaginal lumen failed to reveal differences which could explain the reduction in bacterial numbers between estrus and metestrus. The cyclic changes in the bacterial population-consisting of species which are normally present in the intestinal flora-- seem to be controlled by cyclic changes in the amounts of cellular debris in the vaginal lumen."

      "Lactate and pyruvate concentrations, and acid-base balance of cerebrospinal fluid in experimentally induced intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage in dogs. The effect of blood injected into either subarachnoid space or subcortical brain tissue upon lactate and pyruvate concentrations as well as acid-base balance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was studied in the anesthetized dog. CSF lactate and lactate/pyruvate ratio (L/P ratio) increased progressively following the intracranial injection of blood and reached the maximum level at six hours after injection. These changes were significantly greater in animals with intracerebral hematoma than in those with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). An increase in CSF lactate and L/P ratio in hemorrhagic CSF seems to be caused by two different factors. Shed blood cells per se produce lactate and pyruvate, and blood in the subarachnoid space and intracerebral hematomas cause secondary changes in brain tissue metabolism by a probable reduction of cerebral blood flow. Therefore, an increase in CSF lactate with a concomitant rise in CSF L/P ratio is a useful indicator for brain tissue hypoxia, even when CSF is hemorrhagic. The association of an increase in CSF lactate to a disproportionate decrease in CSF HCO-3 was also observed in these animals.",

Cardiorespiratory reflex responses to laryngeal chemoreceptor stimulation were studied in 62 piglets of both sexes varying in age from 1 to 79 days.

Introduction of either water or milk produced apnea, bradycardia, and hypertension. Swab application of test fluids to the laryngeal epithelium produced similar responses. The reflex could be interrupted by flushing the laryngeal region with saline, by cutting the superior laryngeal nerves (SLN) or by anesthetizing the laryngeal epithelium with lidocaine. Electrical stimulation of SLN elicited identical responses. Respiratory inhibition by the reflex was enhanced following central depression with chloralose and overridden by administration of the respiratory stimulant, aminophylline. The relative potency of the laryngeal reflex was estimated to be equivalent to about 40% of the dose of chloralose which produced permanent respiratory arrest. It is concluded that in circumstances where respiratory drive is reduced the laryngeal inhibitory reflex is capable of caused persistent apnea and asphyxial death in the young piglet.",

      "Biochemical and anatomical adaptation of the lung to oxygen-induced injury. A review of anatomical and biochemical responses of the lung to high concentrations of oxygen leads us to postulate a biphasic adaptive response. The early phase entails a defense against life-threatening pulmonary edema engendered by destruction of oxygen susceptible cells forming most of the air-blood interface. This defense is brought about by type II alveolar cell replication to reform a continuous epithelial layer in the alveoli; its success would depend upon the rapidly with which this continuity can be reestablished. Factors favoring a successful defense would include an initial large population of type II cells or the ability of type II cells to divide fast enough to reestablish continuity before of oxygen-sensitive cells (type 1 alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells) proceeds to fatal pulmonary edema; both conditions probably exist in young animals, which are known to be more resistant to hyperoxia than old animals. The second phase of adaptation would require the development of increased tolerance of previously susceptible cells to continued exposure to high oxygen concentrations to prevent their total destruction. We postulate that here the development of new biochemical defenses or the augmentation of those previously present would play a major role."

It has been proposed that the responses of the cerebral circulation to hypoxia, hypercapnia and hypotension may be partially mediated by an autonomic reflex with receptors in the carotid body or sinus serving as sensors and the efferent limbs being the 7th cranial nerves. Transection of the 7th cranial nerve has been reported to impair the cerebral circulatory response to isolated chemoreceptor stimulation by hypoxia and hypercapnia. To test this hypothesis we measured cerebral blood flow (CBF) by an intra-arterial 133Xe technique in 10 baboons during periods of induced hypoxia and hypercapnia, both before and after transection of the 7th cranial nerve, We found that the responses of CBF were unaltered by either unilateral or bilateral section of the nerve.

      "The removal of non-collagen components from newborn calf dermis with magnesium chloride solution. 1. Non-collagenous substances in newborn calf dermis were extracted with solutions of various concentrations of MgCl2. The total protein and hydroxyproline contents in MgCl2 extracts increased with increase in the concentration of MgCl2 in the solutions. In particular, steep increases of their contents were observed at concentrations of MgCl2 from 0.5 to 1.0 M. Total amounts of hydroxyproline in 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 M MgCl2 extracts were equivalent to 40-50% of the hydroxyproline content in the whole connective tissue. Hexose and hexosamine contents of MgCl2 extracts increased with increase of the MgCl2 concentration. Hexuronic acid was hardly present in the residues after extractions with 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 M MgCl2. 2. Plasma proteins, hyaluronic acid, and dermatan sulfate were extracted at low concentrations of MgCl2. A non-collagenous protein and MgCl2-soluble collagen were extracted with 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 M MgCl2 solutions. The disperson of collagen fibrils was observed in the residue extracted with 1.0 M MgCl2 solution by electron microscopy; the fibril structure of collagen was disordered by extraction with 2.0 and 3.0 M MgCl2. The results suggest that the dispersion and disorder of collagen fibrils lead to the release of a non-collagenous protein. Furthermore, it is suggested that the removal of hyaluronic acid and dermatan sulfate was not very effective for the solubilization of a large amount of collagen, but was suitable as a pretreatment to the extraction of a non-collagenous protein accompanied by the solubilization of a large amount of collagen. 3. The non-collagenous protein was purified by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of this protein at pH 8.5 showed a single band moving to the cathode. The non-collagenous protein contained 3.7% hexose, 1.8% hexosamine, and no hexuronic acid. This protein is rich in glycine, glutamic acid, and alanine, and contains neither hydroxyproline nor hydroxylysine. Sedimentation analysis showed a single peak with 1.8 S and the molecular weight was approx. 43,000 as determided by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis."

      "Dependence of phrenic motoneurone output on the oscillatory component of arterial blood gas composition. 1. The hypothesis that respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition influence ventilation has been examined. 2. Phrenic motoneurone output recorded in the C5 root of the left phrenic nerve and the respiratory oscillations of arterial pH in the right common carotid artery were measured in vagotomized anaesthetized dogs which had been paralysed and artificially ventilated. 3. The effect of a change in tidal volume for one or two breaths on phrenic motoneurone output was measured with the inspiratory pump set at a constant frequency similar to, and in phase with, the animal's own respiratory frequency. A reduction of tidal volume to zero or an increase by 30% led to a corresponding change of mean carotid artery pH level. The changes of carotid artery pH resulted in a change of phrenic motoneurone output, predominantly of expiratory time (Te) but to a lesser extent of inspiratory time (T1) and also peak amplitude of 'integrated' phrenic motoneurone output (Phr). Denervation of the carotid bifurcation blocked this response. 4. The onset of movement of the inspiratory pump was triggered by the onset of phrenic motoneurone output. When a time delay was interposed between them, the phase relationship between respiratory oscillations of arterial pH and phrenic motoneurone output altered. The dominant effect was to alter Te; smaller and less consistent changes of Phr and T1 were observed. 5. When the inspiratory pump was maintained at a constant frequency but independent of and slightly different from the animal's own respiratory frequency (as judged by phrenic motoneurone output), the phase relationship between phrenic motoneurone output and the respiratory oscillations of pH changed breath by breath over a sequence of 100-200 breaths, without change of the mean level of arterial blood gas composition. Te varied by up to 30% about its mean value depending on the phase relationship. Ti and Phr were also dependent on the phase relationship but varied to a lesser extent. The changes were comparable to the results obtained in paragraph 4. 6. It was concluded that phrenic motoneurone output is dependent in part on its relationship to the respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition. 7. Information concerning a transient ventilatory disturbance is stored in the arterial blood in the form of an altered pattern of the respiratory oscillations of blood gas composition; this in turn can change breathing by an effect on the carotid bodies.",
      "Sensitivity of the carotid body to within-breath changes in arterial PCO2. Respiration, sinus nerve chemoreceptor discharge, and carotid arterial pH were monitored in cats. Chemoreceptor discharge frequency showed oscillations that had a respiratory period when averaged over many respiratory cycles. These oscillations disappeared when pH oscillations of respiratory period were eliminated from the carotid arterial blood. The maximum sinus nerve discharge was associated with the most acid point of the recorded pH oscillation. Briefly increasing PCO2 by giving CO2-rich saline into the aortic root resulted in brief reduction in carotid arterial pH, and when this reduction occurred during inspiration tidal volume increased, even with a pH change no larger than the pH oscillations. However, increased chemoreceptor discharge could only be demonstrated when each pH change had twice the amplitude of the pH oscillations. Injections of fixed acid mixed with free carbonic anhydrase transiently increased chemoreceptor frequency, whereas injections of fixed acid alone had no effect. The carotid body is therefore sensitive to small rapid changes in arterial PCO2, and the pH electrode record indicates the size of the stimulus except when fixed acid changes are produced too closely upstream."

      "Attachment of Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus to oral surfaces and its possible role in colonization of the mouth and of periodontal pockets. This investigation examined the ability of cells of Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 to adhere to surfaces that might be important for its initial colonization of the mouth and its subsequent colonization in periodontal pockets. Of 48 asaccharolytic strains of B. melaninogenicus, 47 agglutinated human erythrocytes, whereas none of 20 fermentative strains, which included reference cultures of the subspecies intermedius and melaninogenicus, were active. Electron microscopy indicated that both asaccharolytic and fermentative strains possessed pili; hence, the presence of pili did not correlate with the hemagglutinating activities of B. melaninogenicus strains. Both asaccharolytic and fermentative B. melaninogenicus strains suspended in phosphate-buffered saline adhered in high numbers to buccal epithelial cells and to the surfaces of several gram-positive bacteria tested, including Actinomyces viscosus, A. naeslundii, A. israelii, Streptococcus sanguis, and S. mitis. B. melaninogenicus subsp. asaccharolyticus 381 also attached, but in comparatively low numbers, to untreated and to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. Addition of clarified whole saliva to suspensions of strain 381 almost completely eliminated adherence to buccal epithelial cells and to hydroxyapatite surfaces, but saliva had no detectable effect on attachment to gram-positive plaque bacteria. Both fermentative and nonfermentative strains of B. melaninogenicus also attached in high numbers to crevicular epithelial cells derived from human periodontal pockets, but normal human serum strongly inhibited attachment. Serum also inhibited attachment of strain 381 to saliva- and serum-treated hydroxyapatite, but it had little effect upon attachment to gram-positive bacteria. These observations suggested that salivary and serum components would strongly inhibit the attachment of B. melaninogenicus cells to several oral surfaces, but not to the surfaces of certain gram-positive bacteria commonly present in human dental plaque. This was confirmed by an in vivo experiment in which streptomycin-labeled cells of B. melaninogenicus 381-R were introduced into the mouths of two volunteers. After 10 min, several hundred-fold higher numbers of the organism were recovered from preformed bacterial plaque present on teeth than from clean tooth surfaces or from the buccal mucosa and tongue dorsum. High numbers of B. melaninogenicus cells were also recovered from preformed plaque after 150 min, but virtually no cells of the organism were recovered from the other surfaces studied. These data suggest that the presence of dental plaque containing Actinomyces and other gram-positive bacteria may be essential for the attachment and colonization of B. melaninogenicus cells after their initial introduction into the mouth. Similarly, the presence of subgingival plaque containing gram-positive bacteria may be necessary for its secondary colonization in periodontal pockets."

Respiratory distress due to laryngeal obstruction produces a more or less dramatic syndrome depending on the cause of the obstruction and its evolution in time. Treatment should be immediate in order to avoid death or cerebral and cardiac sequelae. It consists, above all, of restoring the patency of the respiratory tract, the short-circuit obtained by intubation or tracheotomy should, in no case, leave any laryngeal sequelae. The authors present their personal series based on a study of respiratory distress due to laryngeal obstruction in the child. These observations were obtained from a large series of 480 cases of laryngeal dyspnea observed over the last 5 years on the E.N.T. unit of the Edouard Herriot Hospital in Lyons. They contrast a very small number of sub-glottic laryngitis cases requiring intubation or tracheotomy to a very large number of cases of subglottic laryngitis, even with respiratory distress, which recovered with well designed medical treatment. Foreign bodies, of which they report eleven cases, all required emergency surgery. They emphasize the severity of this cause. As far as papillomas and angiomas are concerned, they require emergency treatment, either straightaway or after a trial of medical treatment.",
      "[Surgery of cancer of the larynx. The patient in the pre-, per-, and postoperative period]. Surgery of tumours of the larynx requires two main types of operation: -Extensive laryngeal surgery including: -the full pre-operative assessment and preparation of the patient's general condition which is always poor, e.g. due to alcoholism or respiratory failure. -variable techniques, adapted to the lesion, for the control of the patency of the upper airway. -operative risks, such as: reventilation shock, reflex cardiac arrest, disorders of cardiac rythm and gas embolism. -Its complications: -may be immediate and poorly specific, especially respiratory, neurological and infective. -secondary and more specific e.g. Pharyngostoma, and tracheal stenosis. -late complications due to spread of a malignant process. -Laryngeal surgery limited to one vocal cord for which local anaesthetic, improved by neuroleptanalgesia, such as Diethazine-Diparcol, best meets the surgeon and the interest of the patient.",
      "[Apneic anesthesia in unventilated patients for various operations and explorations in laryngotracheal surgery]. A technique of anesthesia is considered for laryngoscopy in suspension, and certain acts of surgery of the vocal cords, e.g. myxoma, and of the trachea, e.g. destruction of papillomatosis. The patient is in apnea, unventilated, a catheter brings down to the level of the carena a current of oxygen of 15 liters per minute, the gaseous acidosis is buffered by injections of a solution of molar sodium bicarbonate. After briefly recalling the notions which justify this technique, its repercussion on homeostasis is studied by arterial gasometry. General anaesthesia with apneic oxygenation may offer the ENT surgeon increased possibilities of exploration and operation at the level of the larynx and trachea, but owing to its biological consequences, it should be used only with circumspection and its indications should be totally justified, for acts of limited duration. The technique seems, at present, difficult to adapt to surgery with laser."

The effects of the beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol (100 microgram/kg i.v.) and of the alpha-receptor blocking agent dihydroergotamine (50 microgram/kg i.v.) on hemodynamic responses to isoproterenol and norepinephrine (both 1--1024 ng/kg) were investigated in anesthetized dogs. The effects studied were: (1) flow in the ascending aorta and the coronary, common hepatic, gastroduodenal, splenic, cranial mesenteric, renal and femoral arteries: (2) maximal flow acceleration in the splenic, cranial mesenteric and femoral arteries; (3) maximal rate of change of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt max). Propranolol shifted the dose-response curves for the isoproterenol-induced flow increases in the common hepatic, gastro-duodenal, and cranial mesenteric arteries to the right. It did not influence the flow responses to isoproterenol in the ascending aorta or the coronary, splenic, renal and femoral arteries. Propranolol prevented the decrease of arterial pressure evoked by isoproterenol. Propranolol shifted the isoproterenol-induced increase of LV dP/dt max and maximal blood flow to the same extent. Propranolol blocked the flow to the liver and gastrointestinal tract to a greater extent than the LV dP/dt max and maximal flow acceleration. Propranolol had no effect on the norepinephrine-induced increases in flow in the splenic, femoral and coronary arteries, but blocked the norepinephrine-evoked increases of flow accelerations and LV dP/dt max to the same extent. Dihydroergotamine inhibited the norepinephrine-induced increase in flow in the femoral artery and the decreases in flow in the hepatic, splenic, cranial mesenteric and renal arteries, and reversed the reduction of flow in the gastroduodenal artery. It is argued that dihydroergotamine may inhibit the increase in femoral flow through two mechanisms: (1) blocking the flow reduction to norepinephrine in the abdomen, and thereby passively shunting blood from the abdomen in preference to the femoral bed; (2) attenuating the norepinephrine-evoked reflexogenic femoral vasodilatation. It is concluded that: (1) propranolol is a beta-receptor blocking agent with a preference for blockade of isoproterenol-induced vascular effects; (2) norepinephrine-induced flow increases are not direct actions on vascular beta-receptors; (3) the increase of maximal blood flow accelerations after isoproterenol and norepinephrine is mediated by stimulation of cardiac beta-receptors; (4) dihydroergotamine is an alpha-receptor blocking agent particularly in the splanchnic vascular region.",
      "[The problem of dissecting aneurysm of the aorta and its benign course]. On the basis of a personal case, the clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic problems of variants of dissecting aneurysm of the aorta with benign course are discussed. The usefulness of cardio-aortic angioscintigraphy in the interests of early diagnosis of aneurysm and aortography by catheterism for specifying its location and extent, is pointed out. Spontaneous benign development would seem to be tied up with the affected area of the aorta, the modalities of dissection, and above all with the establishment of a distal return breach for blood flow into the aortic lumen. The predominant role of cystic medionecrosis in determining dissection is stressed and the usefulness of intensive pharmacological therapy based essentially on hypotensive and beta-blocking substances confirmed.",
      "Total brain ischaemia in dogs: cerebral physiological and metabolic changes after 15 minutes of circulatory arrest. Cross-clamping of the ascending aorta in dogs for 15 min produced severe neurological deficit, observed for up to 20 h. Immediately after restoration of the circulation, the intracranial pressure in the cisterna magna increased transiently to a mean peak of 22.8 Torr (SD +/- 1.7) because of a compensatory increase in systemic arterial pressure, without a fall in cerebral perfusion pressure. The intracranial pressure returned to control values 15-30 min after ischaemia and showed no secondary rise during the 8 h of observation. The electroencephalogram became isoelectric 34 +/- 6.5 s (mean +/-SD) after circulatory occlusion, and was abnormal when it reappeared 5 h 36 min (SD +/- 2 h 4 min) after the circulation was restored. The electrical impedance of the brain increased immediately after ischaemia and returned rapidly towards pre-ischaemic values during re-perfusion. The cerebral water had not increased measurably 4 h after ischaemia. After ischaemia, the lactate concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid increased to 4.7 mequiv./1(SEM +/-0.1) and the pH decreased to 7.17 (SEM +/-0.02); both returned to control values after 3.5 h. The cerebral glucose uptake was decreased 35 min after ischaemia, cerebral oxygen uptake remained unchanged but cerebral blood flow decreased (P less than 0.05 at 90 min). Immediately after cardiac arrest, recovery was impaired more by the presence of focal abnormal brain perfusion than by intracranial hypertension."

On the first loaded breath, ED and EIC increased reflexly due chiefly to prolongation of inspiration. Vagotomy or vagal cooling to block the Hering-Breuer reflex eliminated the increase in ED and diminished the increase in EIC.

Computed pleural liquid [HCO-3] was similar to that in venous plasma and hence less than that set by the Donnan effect, with which Na+ and Cl- approximately complied. In vitro, pH, [Na+], [Cl-], and computed [HCO-3] were significantly lower (delta = 0.030 +/- 0.004; -2.6 +/- 0.5; -1.2 +/- 0.5 and -1.7 +/- 0.2 meq/L, respectively) on the serosal than on interstitial side of pleural specimens, PCO2 being 42 mm Hg on both sides . HCO-3 and Na+ were not distributed according to transpleural potential (-0.4 +/- 0.1 mV on serosal side), suggesting an active transport of Na+ and HCO-3 from pleural liquid to blood.

      "Some antagonists of dantrolene sodium on the isolated diaphragm muscle of the rat. The effects of a number of potential antagonists of dantrolene sodium have been studied on twitches of the isolated hemidiaphragm preparation of the rat stimulated directly at a frequency of 0-1 Hz, after complete neuromuscular block produced by tubocurarine or erabutoxin a. The substances selected as possible dantrolene antagonists were uranyl ions, thiocyanate ions, adrenaline, caffeine, quazodine, quinine, 4-aminopyridine and the calcium ionophore a23187, all of which facilitate excitation-contraction coupling in one way or another. Contracture was the main feature of the response to A23187, the increase in the tension of the dantrolene-depressed twitches being very slight. All the remaining compounds increased the amplitude of the twitches, but only 4-aminopyridine, quinine, quazodine and caffeine were capable of restoring to the control amplitude twitches that had been maximally depressed by dantrolene. OF these, 4-aminopyridine and quinine were the most potent on a molar basis."

      "Extrinsic neural influences on gastrointestinal motility. The gastrointestinal tract is capable of carrying on all its major functions after all extrinsic nerves have been cut. This automaticity is due to the local nervous mechanisms in the walls of the gastrointestinal tract and the inherent properties of the smooth muscles in its walls, and gastrointestinal hormones. All levels of the central nervous system have been shown, by stimulation and ablation studies, to influence the motility of the entire gastrointestinal tract. Throughout many cerebral areas there are loci which, on stimulation, exert both inhibitory, and less often, excitatory influence on gastrointestinal motility. These influences are mediated by sympathetic and parasympathetic visceral efferent nerves, as well as humoral agents from the neurohypophysis. Thus, they impose an influence of higher control on the automatically efficient intrinsic motility. They are guided by information received from visceral, cranial, and somatic afferents, as well as intracerebral, or psychic inputs. Under normal circumstances they only influence gastrointestinal activity as will best afford the optimal functioning of a performance done automatically with efficiency and finesse.",
      "[The sympathetic neuron: regulation mechanisms for transmitter synthesis, transmitter release, and stimulus response (author's transl)]. A great multitude of factors acting at different sites of the afferent sympathetic nerve are capable to modify the magnitude of its stimulus-induced effects. 1) Specific receptors, located at the ganglionic synapse display inhibitory of facilitatory effects on the ganglionic transmission of the nerve impulse. 2) The rate of synthesis of the neurotransmitter noradrenalin is regulated at the level of the tyrosine hydroxylase. Transsynaptic mechanisms adapt the rate of synthesis of noradrenalin to nerve activity and transmitter release. 3) The amount of transmitter released per nerve impulse is controlled by a variety of receptors located presumably presynaptically at neuronal sites. Inhibitory and facilitatory \"auto\"-receptors stimulated by the released transmitter itself represent a local feed-back control. Similarly receptors for transmitters of cholinergic or serotoninergic neurons as well as autacoid hormones are involved in the local control of noradrenalin release. In addition, kinines, prostaglandins, or compounds like adenosine, some of them released from the target cells by the sympathetic stimuli or delivered by the blood stream are involved in the modulation of stimulus-evoked noradrenalin release. 4) Stimulus responses of the target cells can be modulated by similar mechanisms."

      "Intracellular potassium ion activity in resting and stimulated mouse pancreas and submandibular gland. Intracellular potassium ion activities (aiK+) and membrane potentials were measured with double-barrelled, potassium-specific microelectrodes in superfused mouse pancreas and submandibular gland. Stimulation with the cholinergic agonist bethanechol caused a marked decrease in aiK+ in the submandibular gland, whereas no change in aiK+ could be detected in the pancreas. This indicates that bethanechol increases the permeability of the cell membranes to potassium ions in the submandibular gland but not in the pancreas. Pancreatic acinar cells hyperpolarized promptly when the extracellular potassium ion activity was restored after a prolonged period of potassium deprivation. In comparison, the recovery of aiK+ was a slow process. This finding gives support to the view that the hyperpolarization is due to electrogenic sodium pumping.",
      "Primary hyperparathyroidism with multiple parathyroid gland enlargement: review of 53 cases. Of 53 patients who had hyperparathyroidism assocated with multiple parathyroid gland enlargement, 39 (74%) had primary hyperparathyroidism without clinical or laboratory evidence of associated endocrine gland dysfunction, 2 had documented familial primary hyperparathyroidism, and 12 had hyperparathyroidism as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. When last studied, 31 of the 39 patients with nonfamilial hyperparathyroidism had normal serum calcium levels, 3 had permanent hypoparathyroidism, 2 had recurrent hyperparathyroidism, and 3 were lost to follow-up. The two patients with familial hyperparathyroidism were treated by removal only of enlarged parathyroid glands, and in each, hyperparathyroidism recurred. Five patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1, were treated by removal only of enlarged parathyroid glands, and hyperparathyroidism recurred in four. Four patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1, were treated by removal of three or more parathyroid glands, and there were no instances of recurrent hyperparathyroidism. In one patient, permanent hypoparathyroidism developed. Three patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, type 2, had total parathyroidectomies as a part of thyroidectomy for medullary thyroid carcinoma. In each patient, permanent hypoparathyroidism developed. When primary hyperparathyroidism occurs in the absence of a definite history of polyendocrine or familial disease, only the glands that are definitely enlarged should be removed, and normal-appearing glands should be tagged rather than risk the possibility of permanent hypoparathyroidism that may attend routine subtotal parathyroid gland excision."

A medical-legal opinion in 1962 found no relationship between vaccination and deafness. However, when subsequent judgement appeal was made, the legality of the initial decision had to be justified. The consequence of the case, supported by available publication, indicated that a close temporal probability between vaccination and postvaccinial cerebral complication was required to justify any further legal claim.

Numerous \"chèvres de Maradi\" are bred in Republique du Niger (cap. Niamey), 2 - 10(+6) numbered in 1973. This rustic ruminant is often very parasitized by intestinal nematodes and sporozoa. The most frequent genera are Bunostomum (55%), Trichostrongylus (40%), Strongyloides (27%), Oesophagostomum and Haemonchus (20%), sometimes Moniezia or Stilesia, coccidiosis being endemic and very pathogenic, Eimeria (70%). Polyparasitism is a \"modus vivendi\" between the host and these various parasites. All modification of the number or the kind of parasites (prevalence of one or two genera) involves a variation of the differential leucocyte count (anthelmintic cure for example). When the normal leucocyte count is 18 to 22 - 10(+3) per mm3, whose neutrophils: 40.73%; acidophils: 2%; basophils: 0.28%; monocytes: 11.28%; lymphocytes (small and big forms): 45.71%, a tapeworm parasitism by adults (Moniezia or Stilesia) or by peritoneal larvae (Cysticercus sp.) involves a light eosinophilia (8%), in morbid cases of coccidiosis, neutrophilia prevails (70%), and a polyparasitism with nematodes and Eimeria is characterized by monocytosis and neutrophilia, the polynuclear eosinophils being very rare. These observations show the necessity to elaborate simultaneously two cures: the first with an anthelmintic product, the second against coccidia, to avoid an uncertain Eimeria proliferation after the nematode destruction. In African breeding conditions, where polyparasitism is very frequent, such a therapeutic schedule is recommended.",

Brilliant green dye was added after sterilization of the other components This formulation supported good growth of all of 39 strains of Salmonella tested. Normal biochemical types formed pink colonies with black centers, and an H2S-negative S. choleraesuis formed pink colonies without black centers. Of other bacteria tested, only Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and a few Citrobacter strains showed significant growth in 24 h. When lactose was omitted from the formulation, a lactose-fermenting strain formed pink colonies with black centers, and differentiation of Salmonella from the Enterobacter-Klebsiella groups was equally good. Addition of xylose (4.0 g) and L-lysine hydrochloride (5.4 g) to the above formulation improved differentiation between Salmonella and the few Citrobacter strains that grew and produced more intense blackening in Salmonella colonies. Addition of an H2S indicator to brilliant green agar formulations aided in identification of Salmonella colonies, especially in mixtures with other bacteria.

Little information is available on factors influencing physicians (MDs) to delegate health care tasks to physician's assistants (PAs).

Tasks assigned to PAs appeared to be those that MDs judged to require little or no supervision. Tasks that could be performed efficiently by other non-MD personnel were not asigned to PAs. However, PAs were observed at the practice sites to perform tasks which the MDs had indicated could be appropriately assigned to PAs, as well as some tasks that could be performed by other non-MD personnel. The MDs provided health care to 126 (13.6 percent) of the 925 patients seen by PAs for whom the sequences of patient-provider contact were recorded. In these settings, the PAs functioned with a high degree of autonomy in providing health care. These findings have implications for educators and potential employers of PAs.",
      "Evaluation of enrichment, storage, and age of blood agar medium in relation to its ability to support growth of anaerobic bacteria. By measuring the colony size of a variety of anaerobic bacteria isolated from clinical specimens, an evaluation was made of the benefits derived from the addition of several enrichments to blood agar medium commonly used for the growth of anaerobes. Similar methods were used to study the effects of various storage conditions and age of the medium. The results were compared with those obtained on freshly prepared and enriched blood agar plates as well as commercially available blood agar plates. Freshly prepared and enriched blood agar was found to give substantially larger colonies than could be grown on commercially obtained blood agar plates when both were inoculated and incubated under identical conditions. Storage of plating media under CO2 for periods of up to 72 h had only a minor effect on the growth of the anaerobic bacteria studied, but longer periods of storage under CO2 resulted in a less efficient plating medium. Nonenriched brain heart infusion (BHI) was found to be a better basal medium than Trypticase soy agar (TSA) medium. Colony size on fully enriched BHI blood agar plates was greater than nonenriched BHI greater than nonenriched TSA greater than commercially prepared nonenriched TSA plates. The data suggest that freshness of the plates may be as important as using rich media."

Red cell 2,3 DPG levels were increased in the anemia of iron deficiency and were normal in the rabbits with chronic phenylhydrazine-induced anemia at the time of wound excision but were low following phynylhydrazine injection. The results show that chronic anemia per se does not affect the tensile strength and energy adsorption of wound healing. The findings suggest that the wound healing process may differ in certain types of anemia."

In eight of the patients, chest pain with ischemic changes in the electrocardiogram occurred during this procedure or within five minutes after it ended. Coronary arterial spasm appeared after the procedure and disappeared after the administration of nitroglycerin in all four patients in whom coronary cinearteriography was performed. This was evident both before and after the procedure and after sublingual administration of nitroglycerin (0.6 mg). The oral administration of 90 mg of diltiazem, a calcium antagonistic drug, two hours before, completely suppressed the attack induced by the procedure in all of the five patients who received this drug. We conclude that hyperventilation plus Tris-buffer infusion induces coronary arterial spasm and anginal attack in patients with Prinzmetal's variant angina and that diltiazem suppresses these reactions.",

      "Urodynamic studies in prune belly syndrome. A case report. Urodynamic studies were carried out in a 14-year-old boy with Prune Belly Syndrome and terminal renal failure prior and after successful renal transplantation. Increased bladder capacity, nonprovocative detrusor instability and a high compliance were the most characteristic findings during the filling phase of the bladder. During the voiding phase an increased detrusor pressure was demonstrated. Outflow resistance and maximum urinary flow rate were within normal range before and after transplantation. In contrast to the findings before renal transplantation, however, micturition was imbalanced after transplantation (residual urine 100 ml). Urodynamics revealed that the bulging of the posterior urethra, observed in the early voiding phase, was due to a congenital insufficiency of the posterior urethral musculature (megalourethra) and not caused by mechanical obstruction leading to urethral dilatation. It is suggested that detrusor-bladder-neck-dyssynergia is the primary cause of the imbalanced micturition and its consequences (bladder distention, reflux, urinary tract infection, hydronephrosis, pyelonephritis) in patients with Prune Belly Syndrome. The findings of a normal, respectively increased detrusor activity are in contrast to the observations of some authors, describing attenutation and absence of detrusor muscle fibres.

The animals were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. As the basic effects of the compound can be altered by release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerves of heart and vessels, the dogs were pretreated with acebutolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, which decreased heart rate and prolonged atrioventricular conduction and refractoriness. Nifedipine 1,6 and particularly 30 microgram/kg body weight increased the heart rate and decreased atrioventricular conduction time during atrial pacing, whereas atrioventricular conduction time during sinus rhythm and atrioventricular refractoriness were only affected by nifedipine 30 microgram/kg.

      "Treatment of chronic ventricular arrhythmias [proceedings]. Treatment of ventricular arrhythmias at the present time is difficult and requires a strong commitment on the part of the physician and the patient. Adequate documentation of the arrhythmia with continuous ECG recordings (Holter recordings), preferably for 24 hours, should be performed in each case. Exercise testing can be utilized in selected patients, but is generally inferior to the Holter technique. Underlying cardiac pathology should be searched for, utilizing echocardiography in all patients and coronary angiography and left ventriculography in patients with more severe ventricular tachycardias. Estimation of the prognostic significance of the VPBs must be made in the context of the underlying disease, and goals for treatment must be set. Treatment in all cases first requires measures to avoid known precipitating factors. If antiarrhythmic therapy is utilized, a systematic empirical trial of available agents should be undertaken, utilizing repeated Holter monitoring to document effectiveness. Serum levels of the antiarrhythmic medications should be measured in most cases. Combinations of antiarrhythmic agents can be employed if the need is great, but the agents singly are ineffective. If treatment is determined to be ineffective, it should be discontinued. Surgical techniques may be useful in cases of refractory ventricular tachycardia, and they include overdrive pacing, surgical sympathectomy, or ventricular aneurysmectomy with or without coronary bypass. Coronary bypass alone or resection of a hypokinetic but not aneurysmal area of myocardium may be successful in some cases, but the results are less predictable than when a true aneurysm is resected. Electrophysiologic studies, performed as part of the preoperative evaluation and provoking a self-perpetuating ventricular tachycardia, may permit selection of patients suitable for ventriculotomy to interrupt the re-entry pathway. At present, this must be considered experimental and is performed in only a few centers equipped for the required complex epicardial mapping. Surgery has not been shown to affect complex VPBs outside the setting of acute ischemia. Control of ventricular arrhythmias requires a highly individualistic approach with documentation of effectiveness.",
      "Treatment of angina pectoris. Pharmacologic approaches. The short-acting nitrite sublingual nitroglycerin is the cornerstone of drug treatment of angina pectoris. It is most useful when given two to three minutes before activity that may precipitate an anginal attack. If disabling angina persists despite medical management and there is no contraindication, the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol should be tried before coronary artery surgery is considered. Newer bera-adrenergic blocking agents do not appear to be more effective than propranolol. Digitalis may be beneficial in patients with congestive heart failure or with cardiac arrhythmias responsive to digitalis and in some patients with radiographic evidence of left ventricular enlargement or with nocturnal angina resulting from increased left ventricular end-diastolic volume. If bypass graft surgery is done, medical management must be continued postoperatively."

      "Endometrial control: a comparative study of three oral contraceptives. Shortly after completing an OC cycle the relative hormonal deficit caused by discontinuing the hormones results in withdrawal bleeding. Similarly, if one or more oral contraceptive tablets are missed during a cycle, the resulting deficiency may cause breakthrough bleeding. A lower incidence of breakthrough bleeding on the day after one oral contraceptive tablet is missed and later onset of withdrawal bleeding indicate that a particular OC provides better endometrial control. These two measurements are used as indices to compare the endometrial control provided by Ovral, Norinyl 1/50, and Nortestrin 1 in a study of 480 women at the Planned Parenthood Clinic in Seattle during 1974 and 1975. An analysis of the data shows that the normal chance of breakthrough bleeding on a particular day when one oral contraceptive tablet is not missed on the previous day is 0.017, 0.022, and 0.022 for Ovral, Norinyl, Norlestrin users, but the chance on the day after a contraceptive tablet is missed increased by 13 to 16 times for each of the three OCs.

No statistically significant correlation between IUD usage and PID was demonstrated. A significant correlation (P less than 0.01) between previous induced abortion and subsequent PID was found. In the PID group, a significantly higher proportion of previous abdominal and pelvic operations (P less than 0.005) was found as compared to the control group, but the numbers were small. In the absence of a higher frequency of IUD wearers among PID patients as compared with matched controls, we do not believe that there is an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease."

For nucleocapsids isolated from ts II 052 purified virions or from ts II 052-infected cells at 30 degrees C, the RNA was sensitive to pancreatic RNase after an exposure at 39.5 degrees C in contrast to the resistance observed for wild-type virus. The nucleocapsid stability of wild-type virus when heated to 63 degrees C or submitted to varying pH was not found in nucleocapsids extracted from ts II 052 purified virions. The data suggest that for ts II 052 there is an altered relationship between the viral 38S RNA and the nucleocapsid protein(s) by comparison with wild-type virus. Such results argue for the complementation group II gene product being N protein, so that the ts defect in ts II 052 represents an altered N protein."

Numerous \"chèvres de Maradi\" are bred in Republique du Niger (cap. Niamey), 2 - 10(+6) numbered in 1973. This rustic ruminant is often very parasitized by intestinal nematodes and sporozoa. The most frequent genera are Bunostomum (55%), Trichostrongylus (40%), Strongyloides (27%), Oesophagostomum and Haemonchus (20%), sometimes Moniezia or Stilesia, coccidiosis being endemic and very pathogenic, Eimeria (70%). Polyparasitism is a \"modus vivendi\" between the host and these various parasites. All modification of the number or the kind of parasites (prevalence of one or two genera) involves a variation of the differential leucocyte count (anthelmintic cure for example). When the normal leucocyte count is 18 to 22 - 10(+3) per mm3, whose neutrophils: 40.73%; acidophils: 2%; basophils: 0.28%; monocytes: 11.28%; lymphocytes (small and big forms): 45.71%, a tapeworm parasitism by adults (Moniezia or Stilesia) or by peritoneal larvae (Cysticercus sp.) involves a light eosinophilia (8%), in morbid cases of coccidiosis, neutrophilia prevails (70%), and a polyparasitism with nematodes and Eimeria is characterized by monocytosis and neutrophilia, the polynuclear eosinophils being very rare. These observations show the necessity to elaborate simultaneously two cures: the first with an anthelmintic product, the second against coccidia, to avoid an uncertain Eimeria proliferation after the nematode destruction. In African breeding conditions, where polyparasitism is very frequent, such a therapeutic schedule is recommended.",

The patients were subdivided into two groups, depending on the presence or absence of liver metastases, confirmed at laparatomy, laparascopy or necropsy material examination. The results revealed that in patients with liver metastases AP, CE, GOT, GGTP, ESR and Weltman test are most commonly and simultaneously abnormal. In patients without liver metastases, those indices are also changed but to a lesser degree, whereas LAP and Regan isoenyzme are with elevated activity in a higher per cent of these cases, than in the patients with liver metastases, being in unison with literature data.

The consequence of the case, supported by available publication, indicated that a close temporal probability between vaccination and postvaccinial cerebral complication was required to justify any further legal claim. This was not considered to be a factor in the present case since the discovery of a goitre in the patient in association with an iodine dysfunction uncovered a Pendred's syndrome as the cause for the patient's hearing loss."

      "The effects of isoprenaline and a new beta-sympathomimetic amine upon spontaneous activity, diastolic depolarization and plateau height in cardiac Purkinje fibres. 1 In spontaneously active Purkinje fibres of young cows the dose-response curves of the action of isoprenaline upon different electrophysiological parameters were measured.2 The increase in slope of diastolic depolarization could roughly be described by a one-for-one binding curve with a half maximum effect near 10(-8) M and the increase in the height of the plateau level by a two-for-one binding curve with a half maximum effect near 10(-7) M (-)-isoprenaline.3 These dose-response curves were similar to those of two parameters measured under voltage clamp conditions by other authors. The increase in slope of diastolic depolarization behaved like the shift of the activation curve for the pacemaker potassium current towards positive potentials and the growth in plateau height like the increase in the slow inward current mainly carried by Ca ions. From this conformity we propose that the parameters evaluated by us from action potential records could be used for a qualitative analysis of the action of catecholamines on pacemaker potassium current and Ca influx.4 The effects of the isomers of a new drug, 1-isopropylamino-3(4'hydroxyphenoxy)-propan-2-ol (IHP), were evaluated in the same way as those of isoprenaline. The (-)-isomer was at optimal concentrations (10(-5) M) nearly half as effective as isoprenaline in increasing frequency and slope of diastolic depolarization but caused no increase in plateau height. An identical relationship, but at 5 to 10 times higher concentrations, was obtained with the (+)-isomer.5 When 10(-4) M(-)-IHP was added to a preparation equilibrated with a maximum dose of (-)-isoprenaline (10(-6) M), frequency and plateau height declined. This result together with the observation that the effects of IHP could be blocked by the specific beta-antagonist propranolol, revealed the beta-agonistic nature of the new drug. Its inefficiency in increasing the plateau height and thus the slow (Ca) inward current was explained by its relatively low potency and intrinsic activity.",
      "[The effects of dobutamine in postoperative disorders of left ventricular function in coronary patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Apropos of 18 cases]. Increasing doses of dobutamine were administered to the first group of 10 coronarians having undergone and abdominal surgical procedure, and presenting, one hour after awakening from the anesthesia, hemodynamic modifications with a diminution of cardiac index (CI), systolic index (SI), systolic work index of the left ventricle (SWILV) increase in the pulmonary capillary pressure (PCP), and in the total peripheral resistance (TPR), as well as an acceleration of the cardiac rate (CR). Doses of dobutamine of 5 or 7.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1 corrected the IC, PCP and TPR. Dobutamine ameliorated the SI and SWILV in an increasing fashion up to a dose of 10 microgram.kg-1.min-1 only and without restoring them to the control values of the pre-operative period. CR progressively increased with the increasing of the doses reaching 126 +/- 21.5 beats min-1 for 15 microgram.kg-1.min-1. Extrasystoles appeared at dose levels of 12.5 and 15 microgram.kg-1.min-1 in two patients. Tests of vascular filling (pre-charge tests) carried out in the second group of patients under 10 microgram,kg-1.min-1 of dobutamine and in a third group under 15 microgram.kg-1.min-1 showed a good cardiac adaptation to filling, equal or superior to that of the pre-operative period. It also appeared that the amelioration of CF obtained with a moderate vascular filling (300 ml of low molecular weight dextran) under 10 microgram.kg-1.min-1 of dobutamine is greatly superior to the amelioration obtained by 10 to 15 microgram.kg-1.min-1 of dobutamine."

      "Some biological and physical properties of molluscum contagiosum virus propagated in cell culture. Molluscum contagiosum virus propagated in FL cells of human amnion origin has a one-step growth cycle time of 12 to 14 h. The appearance and exponential increase of intracellular virus preceded the release of extracellular virus by approximately 2 h. Demonstration of comparable titers of extracellular and intracellular virus at the end of the replication cycle indicated that a substantial amount of virus remained associated with cells exhibiting cytopathogenic changes. Mean buoyant density values of virus in sucrose ranged from 1.275 to 1.278 g/cm3, but in CsCl the virus banded at densities at 1.325 to 1.340 and 1.261 to 1.281 g/cm3. Although virus infectivity was not affected by high concentrations of CsCl, it was found by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that the salt removed several nonglycosylated polypeptides with estimated molecular weights of 15,000 to 60,000. This suggested that the high-density band (1.325 to 1.340) may reflect the loss of these structural components. The half-life of virus infectivity was approximately 26.5 h at 26 degrees C and 11.2 h at 37 degrees C. Although the virus was rapidly inactivated at 50 degrees C, it could be stabilized at this temperature by the presence of 1.0 M MgCl2. Virus did not agglutinate newborn chick, adult chicken, or type \"0\" human erythrocytes. Virus infectivity was found to be sensitive to acid pH but resistant to treatment with diethyl ether or chloroform. The replication of molluscum virus in FL cells was not inhibited by 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, or cytosine arabinonucleoside in noncytotoxic concentrations of 200 to 400 mug/ml, but greater than 99% reduction in the yield of herpes simplex virus or vaccinia virus in FL cells was obtained with 200 mug of these compounds per ml. Guanidinium chloride in concentrations of 100 to 200 mug/ml reduced molluscum virus yields by more than 99.9%."

A case report. A 10-year-old asthmatic boy began to suffer from urticarial rash and moderately severe bronchospasm after 8 weeks' treatment with disodium cromoglycate. Initially, DSCG had helped to control his asthmatic attacks, and steroid therapy could be discontinued. Inhalation provocation test with DSCG aerosol, 4 months after stopping DSCG treatment, showed an immediate-type 1 response and urticaria. A repeat provocation test, under antihistaminic cover , failed to produce similar response. When DSCG was withdrawn, urticaria vanished and the child remained symptom-free. Disodium cromoglycate is regarded as the possible aetiological agent.",
      "The protective effect of a new agent, ketotifen syrup, in the treatment of childhood asthma. Twenty-two children with perennial extrinsic allergic asthma participated in a double-blinded, controlled, cross-over study of Ketotifen syrup during a 2 x 6-week period. The placebo was identical with the active drug in taste, colour, and consistency. The dosage level was, on weight basis, a little higher than the standard dosage for adults. The double-blinded investigation was supplemented with a 1 2-week open study of the tolerance for Ketotifen. This study also involved 22 patients, 12 new ones, and 10 from the double-blind study. The study showed Ketotifen to have no effect on changes in lung function (peak flow), on reduction in frequency of asthmatic attacks, or on consumption of additional medicine. The tolerance for Ketotifen was good, but physicians are advised to watch for increases in weight and decreases in blood pressure during tests on children which involve higher dosage levels.",
      "Bronchial reactivity in asthma to inhaled histamine during treatment with ketotifen. A 12-week open trial using varying dosages of ketotifen, an oral drug with a prophylactic anti-asthmatic effect, was carried out in 20 patients with stable chronic bronchial asthma (age 20--50 years, no steroid treatment) to determine whether the frequency of asthma attacks and bronchodilator consumption could be reduced, and whether pulmonary function would improve. The protective action of ketoifen against a histamine inhalation test was measured at the beginning of the trial and at regular intervals during the trial. The patients experienced a significant improvement in their asthma and a significant decrease in the number of asthma attacks during the trial. Concomitantly, the need for other anti-asthma agents was reduced. Pulmonary function tests improved before and following histamine inhalation after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. In some patients cromoglycate was successfully replaced by ketotifen. Efficacy was rated as very good or good in 17 patients and moderate in 3 patients. Tolerance was good in all patients, no serious side-effects were observed. Summing up, it may be stated that ketotifen is a compound which by virtue of its activity profile and route of administration offers a new approach to the prophylactic treatment of bronchial asthma."

      "Sudden infant death syndrome (crib death). Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is diagnosed by the absence of lethal autopsy findings, or in a resuscitatable, \"near miss\" form with cyanosis, apnea, and bradycardia. The event is unexpected, although a minor respiratory infection is common, and occurs during sleep, between 1 and 6 months of age. There is growing evidence that the victims have had previous hypoxic episodes. Although suffocation is no longer considered a tenable explanation, other forms of airway obstruction are still postulated by many; the evidence, however, favors hypoxia as the common feature. A lethal arrhythmia had been proposed by several groups, based on inappropriate reflex activity, \"pathology\" of the conduction system, and the long QT syndrome, but the evidence is against arrhythmia as the primary event in most cases of SIDS. Based on the reversible \"near miss,\" apnea is likely as the primary event in SIDS. Several reflexes have the ability to produce apnea, in addition to the relatively common sleep apnea; the crucial aspect, rather, appears to be thefailure of the immature infant to resume respiration. The possibility exists that the infant, who did not have to breather for 9 months of fetal life, literally is not alarmed and aroused by the persistance of apnea. In human and animal studies, respiratory infections and sleep deprivation have been proved to increase the likelihood and duration of sleep apnea. If primary apnea continues for long (45 seconds or more), a dangerous positive feedback develops into hypoxic apnea. Hhis will persist until circulatory failure occurs, or until gasping occurs. The gasp is a highly effective mechanism at birth, but will occur too late for autoresuscitation after the anerobic capacity of fetal life dimineshes; we believe this capacity lasts for approximately 1 month, accounting for the hiatus of crib death, sparing the first month. The \"near-miss\" infant, after resuscitation, should be monitored at home, if practical, until 6 months of age. A simple cardiac monitor for bradycardia has definite advantage over an apnea monitor alone.",
      "Some practical results of the London Medical Group conference on iatrogenic disease. Although many conferences stimulate a great deal of discussion and practical interest at the time, not so many are followed up to try and estimate what, if any, practical results followed the meeting. This the authors of this study have done. (In Britain the 'medical groups' are voluntary groupings of students at medical schools who meet to discuss ethical problems related to their profession). Sixty-five participants (not all of them students) in the conference on iatrogenic disease replied to the questionnaire, and from the answers it was clear that not only the attitudes of those responding had in some cases been changed but in some positive action had resulted, for example, in the matter of prescribing. This analysis may provide an answer to those who criticize conferences as being a waste of time and money, because much more than could be evaluated from the responses to this survey must have affected all the participants."

      "Double-blind study of the effect of cardioselective beta-blockade on chest pain in acute myocardial infarction. A double-blind study including three different cardioselective beta-blockers, practolol, H 87/07 and metoprolol, was performed in 54 patients with acute myocardial infarction and chest pain shortly after onset of symptoms. Transmural infarctions were found in 42 patients while 12 patients had nontransmural infarctions. Chest pain and the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly reduced in the beta-blocker groups whereas no changes were seen after saline. All patients with nontransmural infarctions and 14 out of 29 with transmural infarctions got pain relief lasting for at least 30 min. None of the patients developed signs of left ventricular backward failure, shock, or bradycardia. A decrease in ST segment elevation was observed in all the transmural infarctions after beta-blockade. No changes in ST segment elevation were found after analgesics when given after saline, but in some cases an increase was seen in this parameter when analgesics were given due to insufficient pain relief after beta-blockers or due to return of chest pain. It is suggested that pain relief by beta-blockers indicates decrease of myocardial ischemia.",

Diagnostic studies for the detection of esophageal disorders have been reviewed, and the relative usefulness of these studies has been emphasized.

The influence of gestational age on the probable meaning of features in the antepartal CTG which are not clearly pathological was investigated in 232 births in 1973/74. The umbilical artery pH was significantly lower among premature infants exhibiting abnormal, than among those exhibiting normal CTG patterns. No similar difference was found in term or overdue births. The clinical diagnosis of neonatal condition using the Apgar scheme confirmed biochemical findings: The frequency of depressed babies is in turn clearly higher in cases with abnormal antepartal CTG patterns. It is assumed that the reason for this is the higher sensitivity of premature babies to haemodynamic disturbances. Thus, it follows that premature babies exhibiting antepartal patterns which are not completely normal require close observation."

Immunological responses are divided into those mediated by humoral antibody (B-Cells) and those by cells (T-Cells). Both depend upon the activity of small lymphocytes which become thymus or bursa analogue dependent during embryonic development. Primary immundeficiencies are therefor defects of lymphocytes attributed in most cases to gene defects. Early diagnosis is the necessary prerequisit for possible treatment. Tests for assessing the cellular immune status are: skin testes and in vitro tests. Clinical syndroms are: lymphocytopenia, hypoplasia, deficiency of lymphocytes in lymphatic tissues normal cortical germinal centres. Recurrent infections with viruses, candida or pneumocystis carinii are common. Tests for assesing the humoral immune status are: measurement of immunglobulin levels in serum, isohaemagglutinins, tests for antibody formation following active immunization, in vitro tests. Clinical syndroms are: no germinal centres in lymphnodes, no plasma cells. Recurrent bacterial infections. Treatment of B-cell deficiencies: immunglobulin replacement therapy. Treatment of T-cell deficiencies by grafting of thymus transplants. Combined immune deficiencies are treated with bone marrow transplants from matched donors. For bone marrow transplantation germfree state seems to be the ideal situation to protect the patient against infection before the therapeutic maneuver and for prevention of graft versus host reaction in the posttransplantation period.",
      "Bacterial precipitins and their immunoglobulin class in atopic asthma, non-atopic asthma, and chronic bronchitis. In a study of groups of patients with atopic (extrinsic) asthma, non-atopic (intrinsic) asthma, and chronic bronchitis, no difference could be detected in the numbers having precipitating antibodies against species specific antigens from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae compared to suitably matched control subjects. Precipitating antibodies against species specific antigens from Haemophilus influenzae, demonstrated in this investigation by double diffusion in agar gel, were found much more frequently in patients with chronic mucopurulent or obstructive bronchitis (50%) than in either asthmatic subjects (6%) or normal controls (6%) (P = less than 0.0005). While the precipitating antibody demonstrated in these patients against the extracts of Str. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus was in the IgG class alone, IgM and IgA antibody were detected against the species specific but not the non-species specific antigens of H. influenzae. These results underline the importance of H. influenzae as an infecting agent in chronic bronchitis and suggest that the finding of precipitins against the species specific H1 and H2 antigens of this bacterium denotes infection either concurrently or in the recent past. There is no evidence to suggest from this study that infection with Staph. aureus, Str. pneumoniae or H. influenzae is any more common in asthmatics as a group compared to controls or between patients with the non-atopic (intrinsic) and atopic (extrinsic) form of the disease.",

The test was negative in 29 pneumonia patients with negative sputum culture for S. pneumoniae. Pneumococcal antigen was also detected in the sputum of six of nine adults with chronic bronchitis and a positive sputum culture, but was not detected in expectorated respiratory secretions of 22 pneumococcal carriers with colds. Pneumococcal antigen could also be detected in sputum by immunodiffusion; antigen titers varied from 1:2 to 1:256. These results strongly suggest that the detection of pneumococcal antigen in respiratory tract secretions indicates infection caused by S. pneumoniae."

Numerous \"chèvres de Maradi\" are bred in Republique du Niger (cap. Niamey), 2 - 10(+6) numbered in 1973. This rustic ruminant is often very parasitized by intestinal nematodes and sporozoa. The most frequent genera are Bunostomum (55%), Trichostrongylus (40%), Strongyloides (27%), Oesophagostomum and Haemonchus (20%), sometimes Moniezia or Stilesia, coccidiosis being endemic and very pathogenic, Eimeria (70%). Polyparasitism is a \"modus vivendi\" between the host and these various parasites. All modification of the number or the kind of parasites (prevalence of one or two genera) involves a variation of the differential leucocyte count (anthelmintic cure for example). When the normal leucocyte count is 18 to 22 - 10(+3) per mm3, whose neutrophils: 40.73%; acidophils: 2%; basophils: 0.28%; monocytes: 11.28%; lymphocytes (small and big forms): 45.71%, a tapeworm parasitism by adults (Moniezia or Stilesia) or by peritoneal larvae (Cysticercus sp.) involves a light eosinophilia (8%), in morbid cases of coccidiosis, neutrophilia prevails (70%), and a polyparasitism with nematodes and Eimeria is characterized by monocytosis and neutrophilia, the polynuclear eosinophils being very rare. These observations show the necessity to elaborate simultaneously two cures: the first with an anthelmintic product, the second against coccidia, to avoid an uncertain Eimeria proliferation after the nematode destruction. In African breeding conditions, where polyparasitism is very frequent, such a therapeutic schedule is recommended.",
      "Effects of staphylococcal products on locomotion and chemotaxis of human blood neutrophils and monocytes. The effects of staphylococcal products as chemo-attractants for human blood neutrophils and monocytes and as inhibitors of locomotion of these cells were studied with bacterial cells, culture filtrates and isoelectrically focused fractions from culture filtrates of nine strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Little direct chemotactic activity of staphylococcal products for neutrophils was observed, although a chloroform-soluble extract of the whole organisms contained such activity. The major chemotactic effect of staphylococci for neutrophils was indirect, i.e., generated when the organisms or their products were incubated with plasma, perhaps due to activation of complement. In contrast, direct chemotactic activity for monocytes was found in a large number of staphylococcal fractions. Staphylococci also produced inhibitors of locomotion of both neutrophils and monocytes. Isoelectric focusing showed more fractions inhibitory for neutrophils than for monocytes. Some of the inhibitors could be identified. Staphylococcal alpha-toxin inhibited migration of both neutrophils and monocytes. Sphingomyelinase C (beta toxin) inhibited migration of monocytes but not of neutrophils. Leucocidin-rich strains were strongly active as inhibitors of neutrophil locomotion but less so as inhibitors of monocyte locomotion.",

Awake domestic pigeons, either maintained at 22 degrees C (series I) or acutely exposed at 2 degrees C (series II), were studied in a hypobaric chamber at 140 m and at various stages during a 4-week exposure to 4000 m. Steady-state pulmonary ventilation (Vg) and breathing pattern (VT, fr), oxygen consumption (MO2), O2 concentrations and pressures in the arterial (a) and mixed venous blood (v), hematocrit (Ht) and acid-base status in arterial blood, systolic blood pressure and heart frequency (fH) were measured. From these data cardiac output (Vb) and stroke volume (Vs), ventilatory and circulatory requirements (Vg/MO2, Vb/MO2), extraction of O2 from inspired air (EgO2) and blood EbO2), and capacitance coefficient of blood for oxygen (betabo2) were calculated. At 140 m, by comparison with predicted values for mammals of same body weight, pigeons at 22 degrees C extracted more O2 from the inspired gas, with lower fR, larger VT, similar Vg; they extracted O2 from the blood like mammals, with lower fH, larger VS, greater Vb, similar betabO2=70 mumol-L-1-torr-1.

The effect on the nasal symptoms was impressive. Symptom scores decreased, on average, to 12% and the number of antihistamine tablets taken to 18% of the pretreatment amount.

No correlation of the effect of ipratropium bromide with bronchial reactivity to histamine, basal values and antigen induced obstruction as well as corticosteroid dependency could be ascertained.

The interaction of isoniazid with its hepatotoxic metabolite acetylhydrazine has been studied. In vitro, isoniazid at a concentration of 0.5 mM was found to inhibit the microsomal metabolism of acetylhydrazine to a reactive acylating species. In vivo, however, coadministered isoniazid inhibited the acetylation to diacetylhydrazine and concomitantly increased the microsomal metabolism of 14C-acetylhydrazine to a reactive intermediate which covalently bound to liver macromolecules. Comparison of urinary metabolites of isoniazid at two dose levels indicated that acetylation of acetylhydrazine produced as a metabolite may be inhibited by the parent drug.",
      "Factors affecting the metabolism of [14C]acetylhydrazine in rats. Some factors affecting the metabolism of the potent hepatotoxin, acetylhydrazine, were studied in rats. After ip administration of [14C]acetylhydrazine, 36% and 38% of the dose was recovered in the urine and as 14CO2, respectively. The major urinary metabolites were diacetylhydrazine and the pyruvic acid and alpha-oxoglutaric acid acetylhydrazones. The acetylation of acetylhydrazine to diacetylhydrazine was found to be dose-dependent and to be inhibited by coadministered isoniazid and p-aminosalicylic acid. Coadministered acetylisoniazid had no effect on acetylation. The proportion of acetylhydrazine recovered as 14CO2 presumably reflects the amount metabolized by the microsomal oxidation pathway, thought to be responsible for the toxicity, and also possibly by hydrolysis to acetate and hydrazine. This latter pathway could not be confirmed, as only a small proportion of hydrazine administered to rats was recovered. The inhibition of acetylation by p-aminosalicyclic acid, but not isoniazid, significantly increased the excretion of 14CO2, suggesting that isoniazid may also inhibit a pathway resulting in the production of 14CO2. These results indicate that the metabolism and hepatotoxicity of acetylhydrazine may be different when it is produced as a metabolite of isoniazid than when it is given alone.",
      "Endometrial control: a comparative study of three oral contraceptives. Shortly after completing an OC cycle the relative hormonal deficit caused by discontinuing the hormones results in withdrawal bleeding. Similarly, if one or more oral contraceptive tablets are missed during a cycle, the resulting deficiency may cause breakthrough bleeding. A lower incidence of breakthrough bleeding on the day after one oral contraceptive tablet is missed and later onset of withdrawal bleeding indicate that a particular OC provides better endometrial control. These two measurements are used as indices to compare the endometrial control provided by Ovral, Norinyl 1/50, and Nortestrin 1 in a study of 480 women at the Planned Parenthood Clinic in Seattle during 1974 and 1975. An analysis of the data shows that the normal chance of breakthrough bleeding on a particular day when one oral contraceptive tablet is not missed on the previous day is 0.017, 0.022, and 0.022 for Ovral, Norinyl, Norlestrin users, but the chance on the day after a contraceptive tablet is missed increased by 13 to 16 times for each of the three OCs. Ovral provides more sustained endometrial control than Norinyl and Norlestrin, however, as indicated by its lower probability of breakthrough bleeding on the day a contraceptive tablet is missed and by its later onset of withdrawal bleeding."

      "Fluid secretion in the duodenum and intestinal handling of water and electrolytes in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The slow marker perfusion technique was used in five patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in order to determine the basal and postcibal flow rates of fluids passing the duodenojejunal junction and distal ileum, and the composition of those fluids. Fecal water and electrolyte excretions were also measured. The 24-hr outputs at the ligament of Treitz were markedly increased, while fecal losses were normal or only slightly increased. Thus, the overall intestinal reabsorption of water was 96%. Fasting rates of fluid and electrolyte flow at the ligament of Treitz were also measured during a basal period, followed by a period of continuous gastric aspiration. Removal of gastric secretion had the following effects on the fluid passing through the duodenum: (1) dramatic decrease in flow rate; (2) an increase in osmolality, from hypotonicity to isotonicity; (3) rise of pH, from acid to alkaline values; (4) a decrease of PCO2, from high to normal values. No increase in fasting plasma levels of immunoreactive secretin and motilin was observed in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, whereas normal subjects respond to acid in the duodenum by a marked rise in the circulating levels of these hormones. These facts suggest that, in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: (1) the ability of the small bowel and colon to reabsorb water and electrolytes is normal: (2) duodenal dissipation of hydrogen ions is mainly due to intraluminal neutralization by bicarbonate; and (3) stimulation of water and electrolyte secretion by the pancreas is  inadequate.",
      "Elevated levels of immunoglobulin E in the acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLS) is a newly recognized disease characterized by fever persisting for more than 5 days, an erythematous skin eruption, conjunctival congestion, dry red fissured lips, reddened tongue, palms, and soles, nonpurulent lymphadenopathy, and sometines diarrhea, arthralgia, and aseptic meningitis. Additional features may include carditis, pericarditis, aneurysmal dilation and thrombosis of coronary arteries, and sudden death. There is a striking similarity of fatal cases to infantile polyarteritis nodosa, a disease recently reported to be associated with elevated levels of serium IgE. Indeed, it is likely that MCLS represents a disease which can progress to polyarteritis nodosa in infants and young children. The paired acute and convalescent serum IgE levels of 20 subjects with acute nonfatal MCLS were studied along with 20 near-age unaffected controls from the same communities in Japan. The results indicate that most if not all subjects with MCLS in the study had an elevation of total serum IgE during the acute phase of the disease (geometric mean 157 IU/ml compared with the control value of 38 IU/ml, P = 0.005). The level appeared to reach a peak 1-2 weeks after onset and declined over the ensuing 1-2 months."

      "Role of fat maldigestion in pathogenesis of steatorrhea in ileal resection. Fat digestion after two sequential test meals with and without cholestyramine. To clarify the role of fat maldigestion in the pathogenesis of steatorrhea in patients with ileal resection the total and aqueous phase concentrations of bile acid and fatty acid were characterized in 8 such patients (5 patients with small ileal resection, bile acid diarrhea, and steatorrhea less than 20 g per day; 3 patients with large ileal resection, fatty acid diarrhea, and steatorrhea greater than 20 g per day) as well as 4 healthy control subjects after a morning and an afternoon liquid test meal. The study was then repeated with cholestyramine, 4 g being administered before each meal to induce fat maldigestion. After a conventional test meal, patients with large resections and severe steatorrhea had significantly lower aqueous phase concentrations of bile acids (and fatty acids) than patients with smaller resections or control subjects, explained in part by intraluminal precipitation of about one-half of the bile acids during digestion. When cholestyramine was administered before the meal, aqueous phase bile acid concentrations decreased in all patients, including the normal control subjects; the degree of fat maldigestion induced in the patients with small resections (and the control subjects) became similar to that present after the conventional test meal in the patients with large resections. Because steatorrhea increased little in the patients with small resections when cholestyramine was administered continuously, the data suggest that fat maldigestion per se does not induce severe fat malabsorption in patients with sufficient anatomical reserve, because such patients can absorb fat efficiently by utilizing the distal small intestine. In patients with large ileal resections, severe steatorrhea is explained in part by the combination of fat maldigestion and decreased surface area. It is also speculated that the steatorrhea occurring in patients with small resections and relatively normal fat digestion during two test meals may be explained by impaired fat digestion which occurs during the final meal of the day, which is often the largest meal."

      "Myocardial function during acute hypoxia in the calf. Hemodynamics and myocardial contractility were evaluated in five unanesthetized calves during acute hypocapnic and isocapnic hypoxia and during acute hypocapnic hypoxia with beta-adrenergic blockade. Both hypocapnic and isocapnic hypoxia, with mean PaO2 levels of 33.1 and 39.1 mm Hg respectively, produced a decline in stroke volume and index, while cardiac output and index were maintained at normoxic control levels by an increase in heart rate. Evaluation of myocardial contractility indices suggested an augmentation of left ventricular contractility during both hypocapnic and isocapnic hypoxia. Beta-adrenergic blockade effectively eliminated the increase in left ventricular contractility during hypocapnic hypoxia, suggesting an important role of the adrenergic nervous system in the genesis of the cardiovascular response of the calf to acute hypoxia. Right ventricular contractility indices failed to demonstrate a clear-cut augmentation of contractility during hypocapnic and isocapnic hypoxia when the concurrent increase in afterload was considered. Mean pulmonary arterial blood pressure rose significantly during hypocapnic and isocapnic hypoxia. The pulmonary pressor response to hypocapnic hypoxia was significantly augmented by beta blockade, indicating that the autonomic nervous system is capable of modifying the hypoxic pulmonary pressor response in this species.",

These results seen to authorise the prolonged use of this drug in the low output syndromes with left ventricular failure whether the cause be ischemic or due to a cardiomyopathy. Nine patients were then treated, with a dosage of 8 microgram/kg/min. The supervision of the treatment was composed of iterative readings of the arterial pressure, the cardiac rate, pulmonary capillary and arterial pressures, and the cardiac index. The hemodynamic results were similar to those obtained in the 17 patients. It seems that this product can be used in the acute stage of myocardial infarction. Indeed its action on the myocardial excitability is small and the moderate increase in the oxygen consumption can be compensated for by the improvement in the myocardial vascularisation."

In cases of necrotizing angiitis caused by basically immunological mechanisms, the walls of the blood vessels may be impaired in varying diffuse degrees. The prognosis of the disease depends on the intensity of the inflammation and its repercussions on the parenchymas of different organs. The kidney is the most susceptible organ in this case. Treatment should be directed toward the avoidance of predisposing and etiologic factors, detection of the immunological reaction, requiring careful and individual attention in every case.",
      "[Antimicrobial resistance and serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae in Switzerland]. One hundred and eighty strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated from various materials at the Institute of Medical Microbiology in Zurich between March and October 1978. Examination of these isolates for resistance to 6 standard antimicrobials revealed that 17 (9.4%) strains were resistant to the tetracyclines, 2 strains to sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim and 1 strain to both tetracycline and chloramphenicol. All strains were highly sensitive to benzylpenicillin, cephalothin and erythromycin. Serotyping of the pneumococci was done by the capsular quellung reaction. The prevalent serotypes in the entire collection of strains were Nos. 6, 23, 19, 3, 9, 14 and 7. The prevalent serotypes of strains isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pus, and bronchial secretions were Nos. 4, 8, 7, 14, 9, 3, 19 and 6. Vaccination with PneumovaxTM, a vaccine containing 14 capsular antigens, should provide protection against 75% of pneumococci identified as true pathogens in this study. Pneumococci are rather rarely isolated in our laboratories. For this reason, and because the strains isolated are still sensitive to antibiotics in conventional use, mass vaccination of the population in Switzerland is not recommended. Vaccination should be carried out in certain high risk groups of patients."

We have previoulsy shown pH compensation to be similar in CSF and arterial blood during chronic hypoxemic hypocapnia in man and pony, and postulated that the compensatory reduction in CSF [HCO3] was dependent upon corresponding changes in [HCO3]a. We tested this hypothesis in anesthetized, paralyzed dogs by determining the effects of 7 or 14 hours of hypocapnia (PaCO2 20 and 30 mm Hg), hypoxemia (PaO2 30, 38 and 48 mm Hg) and hypocapnic hypoxemia on CSF acid-base status. [hco3]a was either permitted to fall normally or was held near control levels by NaHCO3 infusion. In hypocapnia and hypoxemic hypocapnia, the decrease in [HCO3] and % pH compensation in CSF were less than or equal to that in arterial blood. Most (51-89%) of the compensatory decrease in CSF [HCO3] was prevented by preventing the corresponding reduction in [HCO3]a. This dependence of changes in CSF on plasma [HCO3] required a concurrent decrease in CSF PCO2, but was largely independent of variations in plasma pH. A minor but significant portion of the decrease in CSF [HCO3] was achieved independently of corresponding changes in [HCO3]a. The contribution of this local mechanism to CSF [HCO3] regulation increased with increasing severity of hypocapnia or hypoxemia and was usually associated with a selective increase in CSF lactate. It was concluded that [HCO3] regulation in the CSF during hypoxemic hypocapnia was primarily dependent upon, and therefore limited by, the concomitant decrease in plasma [HCO3].",
      "Effect of chronic furosemide administration on hydrogen and sodium excretion in the dog. Studies were performed to evaluate the effects of the chronic administration of furosemide on hydrogen and electrolyte excretion in dogs on a normal electrolyte diet and in the absence of electrolyte or volume depletion. Control daily excretion in five dogs averaged 64 meq for Na, 51 meq for K, 66 meq for Cl, and 17 meq for net H. Furosemide, 40 mg, in the drinking water 3 times daily was given for 4 days. On day 1 Na excretion averaged 128 meq, but thereafter was not significantly different from control levels. Over 4 days cumulative net H excretion increased 63.6 meq and plasma HCO3 rose 6.6 meq/liter. The same dogs were restudied by the same protocol except that, to obviate electrolyte depletion, NaCl and KCl were administered daily in quantities sufficient to replace urinary losses. All dogs remained in positive Na, K, and Cl balance. Body weight, hematocrit, plasma albumin, creatinine, and plasma renin activity were unchanged, indicating the absence of electrolyte or volume depletion. Nonetheless, cumulative net H excretion increased 61.2 meq and plasma HCO3 increased 4.3 meq/liter. Two adrenalectomized dogs receiving steroid replacement showed similar changes in net H excretion and plasma HCO3. These experiments suggest that chronic furosemide administration may enhance H excretion and generate alkalosis even in the absence of volume or electrolyte depletion and without increased aldosterone secretion.",
      "Characterization of (+/-)-methadone uptake by rat lung. 1. By use of a sensitive and specific fluorescence assay procedure it was shown that after subcutaneous administration to rats, (+/-)-methadone was concentrated in the lung. Lung to serum ratios ranging from 25 to 60 were obtained indicating that the rat lung tissue was capable of extracting (+/-)-methadone against a concentration gradient. 2. This phenomenon was investigated in vitro with rat lung slices incubated in Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The uptake was expressed in terms of tissue to medium concentration ratios (T/M ratio). 3. The principal observations were: (i) Studies on the time-course of the uptake showed that the T/M ratios of (+/-)-methadone increased rapidly during the first 60 min of incubation and then more slowly, with a plateau occurring at 180 min; (ii) The T/M ratio of (+/-)-methadone progressively increased from 9.5 to 17 as the pH of the incubation medium was varied from 6.2 to 7.5; (iii) When the concentration of (+/-)-methadone in the incubation medium was varied from 0.005 to 0.5 mM, the T/M ratio decreased rapidly suggesting self-saturation of the transport process. Beyond the medium concentration of 0.5 mM, the T/M ratio declined very slowly. 4. These results suggested that at low concentrations, (+/-)-methadone was transported predominantly by a self-saturable process while at higher concentrations it was transported by a process of simple diffusion. 5. At low concentrations (0.01 mM) the uptake of (+)-methadone was higher than that of (-)-isomer indicating stereo-specificity of the uptake process. The uptake of (+/-)-methadone at low concentration (0.01 mM) was significantly inhibited by low temperature, lack of O2, lack of glucose, lack of Na+ in the incubation medium, and by exposure of the tissue to high temperature (approximately 100 degrees C). The uptake was also inhibited by relatively high concentration of iodoacetate (1.0 mM) and of naloxone (1.0 mM). 6. Kinetic analysis of data showed that the diffusion constant for (+/-)-methadone was 5.0 (h-1) and the Vmax of the active transport process was 6.5 micronmol g-1h-1."

      "[Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and related collagen diseases. Clinical aspects (author's transl)]. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or, more correctly, juvenile chronic polyarthritis with its many clinical manifestations can be separated into the Still-syndrome with acute beginning, high fever and a high percentage of extra-articulalar, i.e. visceral symptoms, and the chronic polyarthritis in the more strict sense with non-visceral symptoms. The subsepsis allergica should be regarded as a subseptic first stage of the Still syndrome. The Still-syndrome implies a systemic disease mainly of the reticulo-endothelial system, with carditis, nephropathy, recurrent erythemas, and a progressing polyarthritis. Later symptoms are amyloidosis, chronic nephritis, myo- and pericarditis, and artheriitis necroticans. Predominanly the involvement of the kidneys is the reasons for the high mortality rate of 13%. Chronic polyarthritis in the strict sense is similar in children and adults, though in children rheumatic factors are rarely detected. The exsudative form of arthritis tends to cause early deterioration. Joint symptoms are distributed asymmetrically and show locally inflammed growth otherwise less common in Still-syndrome. Spondylitis cervicalis rapidly causes ankylosis. Atlanto-axial-arthritis with consequent atlanto-axial dislocation can be the reason for neurological disturbances. Juvenile mono- or oligo-arthritis often turns into polyarthritis; but for joints the prognosis is more favourable. In contrast, rheumatoid iridocyclitis as found in 22% of the cases causes unfavourable complications because symptoms are not noticed in time so that treatment is often too late. Juvenile spondylitis ankylosans begins with a peripheral arthritic stage which is not easily distinguished from chronic polyarthritis. The male sex, mono- or oligoarthritis of the outer extremities, pain in the heel, atlanto-axial-arthritis, iridocyclitis, and a positive HLA of 27 give a diagnostic clue. -- Characteristics of the therapy will be discussed."

One group received the product under examination (FC 35aA) and the other two its components (dipotassic chlorazepate, paracetamol and codeine). FC 35aA gave the best results, pointing to synergism between its components. Increase of the pain threshold and of the actual involvement of the patient was achieved to an extent that the single components could not match when administered individually at the same doses.",
      "The influence of food on nitrofurantoin bioavailability. The effect of food on the absorption of five commercial dosage forms of nitrofurantoin varying widely in drug release and dissolution characteristics was assessed in man after oral administration. Four healthy fasting and nonfasting male subjects received, in a crossover fashion, a single 100-mg dose of microcrystalline nitrofurantoin as an aqueous suspension, three different compressed tablets, and a single 100-mg dose of macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin in a capsule. Both the absorption and the duration of therapeutic urinary concentrations of nitrofurantoin were significantly increased after administration of the five products to nonfasting subjects. The enhancement in the bioavailability of the drug in the presence of food ranged from 20% to 400%, with the greatest absorption-enhancing effect occurring with those dosage forms exhibiting the poorest dissolution characteristics. It is concluded that single-dose comparative bioavailability studies of drug products normally administered with food should be performed in both nonfasting and fasting subjects.",
      "Bronchodilating activity of an H1 blocker, chlorpheniramine. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that chlorpheniramine (CP), and H1 blocker, can cause bronchodilatation if administered intravenously (iv) and in higher doses than those currently prescribed. In 10 subjects with allergic asthma, forced expiratory flows (FEF) were recorded on different days, at comparable baseline values, before and up to 5 hr after administration of 8 mg per os (po) chlorpheniramine, 10 mg iv CP (repeated twice), 5.5 mg/kg iv aminophylline, and 30 mg po butabarbital as well as during a day without drug. Chlorpheniramine administered intravenously produced reproducible increases (+ delta) in FEF, starting at 15 min, peaking at 120 min, and still persisting at 5 hr; the peak + delta averaged 15% for FEV1 and 27% to 53% for flows at low lung volume. FEF showed a comparable + delta after aminophylline, a smaller + delta after orally administered chlorpheniramine and no significant + delta during butabarbital or control sessions. The ratio change over time/variability was higher for FEV1, FEF50%, and FEF25%-75% than for the remaining parameters. In six subjects a double-blind study (chlorpheniramine vs. saline solution) confirmed the effectiveness of the doses administered in the open study. In three subjects, 10 mg iv chlorpheniramine was given at four different baseline values; the highest + delta occurred when the basal FEV1 was approximately 50% of the predicted value and the basal FEF at low lung volume 30% to 40% of the predicted value. In two subjects, log dose-response curves to 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 mg iv chlorpheniramine were obtained by using FEV1, FEF50%, and FEF25%-75%. Thus chlorpheniramine in high iv doses can dilate the bronchi, the + delta FEF depending on the dose, the percent of the predicted basal FEF value, and \"individual\" responsiveness. Withing the dose range used, bronchodilatation to chlorpheniramine and aminophylline administered intravenously was best detected by FEV1, FEF50%, and FEF25%-75%."

Investigated auditory word discrimination skill in children diagnosed as having minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), a heretofore unexplored topic in the study of MBD.

The present study tested the hypothesis that phonemic aural discriminations would be difficult to make for boys diagnosed as having MBD. Errors and nonresponses made while Ss performed an extended auditory word discrimination task were compared between a group of 26 boys diagnosed as having MBD and a matched normal group. As expected, the MBD group had a significantly higher error rate than the normal group even when Ss were discriminating easy word pairs composed of dissimilar items (e.g., reading, math). These and other results suggested that the MBD group was very susceptible to fatigue even while motivated to perform well and while able to improve with practice. The relatively inferior performance of the MBD group was interpreted as resulting directly from a lack of auditory discrimination skill and indirectly from fatigue and its accompanying attention loss.",
      "The effect of parenteral glutamate treatment on the localization of neurotransmitters in the mediobasal hypothalamus. The localization of cholinergic, aminergic and amino acid-ergic neurones in the mediobasal hypothalamus has been studied in normal rat brain and in brains where neurones in nucleus arcuatus were destroyed by repeated administration of 2 mg/g body weight monosodium glutamate to newborn animals. In normal animals acetylcholinesterase staining, choline acetyltransferase and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase were concentrated in the median eminence and the arcuate nucleus. Glutamate decarboxylase was concentrated at the boundary between the ventromedial and the arcuate nuclei, with lower activity in the arcuate nucleus and very low activity in the median eminence. Nucleus arcuatus contained an intermediate level of high affinity glutamate uptake. In the lesioned animals, there were significant decreases in choline acetyltransferase, acetylcholinesterase staining and glutamate decarboxylase in the median eminence, whereas choline acetyltransferase activity and acetylcholinesterase staining, but not glutamate decarboxylase activity, were decreased in nucleus arcuatus. Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase was unchanged in all regions studied. The high affinity uptakes of glutamate, dopamine and noradrenaline, and the endogenous amino acid levels were also unchanged in the treated animals. The results indicate the existence of acetylcholine- and GABA-containing elements in the tuberoinfundibular tract. They further indicate that the dopamine cells in the arcuate nucleus are less sensitive to the toxic effect of glutamate than other cell types, possibly because they contain less glutamate receptors.",
      "Histologic and enzymatic studies of the mesolimbic and mesostriatal serotonergic pathways. Selective lesions of the dorsal (B7), median (B8), or lateral (B9) raphe nuclei were made stereotaxically in male rats 4 weeks before sacrifice. The extent of damage to each raphe nucleus was quantified histologically by means of a simplified formaldehyde histochemical method for visualization of serotonin in cryostat sections. A detailed mapping of the distribution of the yellow-fluorescent raphe perikarya provided the basis for quantification. Tryptophan hydroxylase activity was measured in 6 forebrain regions from each animal, and the results were correlated with the per cent damage to each raphe nucleus. Tyrosine hydroxylase was also assayed in 5 of these regions; it was not significantly affected by any of the raphe lesions. Dorsal raphe lesions reduced tryptophan hydroxylase activity in the striatum, thalamus, cortex, and hypothalamus, but not in the septal nuclei or hippocampus. Damage to B8 resulted in decrements in this serotonergic enzyme in the septal nuclei, hippocampus, cortex, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum or thalamus. Lesions of the scattered B9 cells had no significant effect on enzyme activity in any region examined. These data suggest that the dorsal and median raphe nuclei provide two distinct though perhaps overlapping serotonergic systems innervating different parts of the forebrain: a mesostriatal pathway originating in B7 and a mesolimbic system derived from B8. Behavioral studies on the animals, which are presented in a companion paper, indicated that damage to the median nucleus is responsible for many of the behavioral effects previously reported after combined lesions of both major raphe nuclei."

Fifty-three strains (22%) showed some activity against at least one indicator strain. Both broad- and narrow-spectrum inhibition was detected. Inhibitory isolates of P. acnes outnumbered inhibitory Micrococcaceae by four to one. There was a low frequency of inhibition of S. epidermidis by Micrococcaceae (2.7%) and by P. acnes (1.1%) and a higher frequency of inhibition of P. acnes by Micrococcaceae (9.5%) and by P. acnes (40.8%).

The hypothesis that respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition influence ventilation has been examined. 2. Phrenic motoneurone output recorded in the C5 root of the left phrenic nerve and the respiratory oscillations of arterial pH in the right common carotid artery were measured in vagotomized anaesthetized dogs which had been paralysed and artificially ventilated. 3. The effect of a change in tidal volume for one or two breaths on phrenic motoneurone output was measured with the inspiratory pump set at a constant frequency similar to, and in phase with, the animal's own respiratory frequency. A reduction of tidal volume to zero or an increase by 30% led to a corresponding change of mean carotid artery pH level. The changes of carotid artery pH resulted in a change of phrenic motoneurone output, predominantly of expiratory time (Te) but to a lesser extent of inspiratory time (T1) and also peak amplitude of 'integrated' phrenic motoneurone output (Phr). Denervation of the carotid bifurcation blocked this response. 4. The onset of movement of the inspiratory pump was triggered by the onset of phrenic motoneurone output. When a time delay was interposed between them, the phase relationship between respiratory oscillations of arterial pH and phrenic motoneurone output altered. The dominant effect was to alter Te; smaller and less consistent changes of Phr and T1 were observed. 5. When the inspiratory pump was maintained at a constant frequency but independent of and slightly different from the animal's own respiratory frequency (as judged by phrenic motoneurone output), the phase relationship between phrenic motoneurone output and the respiratory oscillations of pH changed breath by breath over a sequence of 100-200 breaths, without change of the mean level of arterial blood gas composition. Te varied by up to 30% about its mean value depending on the phase relationship. Ti and Phr were also dependent on the phase relationship but varied to a lesser extent. The changes were comparable to the results obtained in paragraph 4. 6. It was concluded that phrenic motoneurone output is dependent in part on its relationship to the respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition. 7. Information concerning a transient ventilatory disturbance is stored in the arterial blood in the form of an altered pattern of the respiratory oscillations of blood gas composition; this in turn can change breathing by an effect on the carotid bodies.",

The oxygen dissociation curve shifted less to the right in venous blood draining from muscle in eight insulin-deficient diabetics working at a constant submaximal workload than in seven normal controls (28.7 mm. Hg vs. 30.8 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). This diminution of the in-vivo Bohr effect at the muscle tissue level during exercise in diabetics was due to a significantly smaller decrease of venous blood pH (down to 7.33 vs. 7.27 in normals; P less than 0.05), probably a consequence of an latered muscle metabolism in insulin deficiency. Although no glucose was taken up, even during exercise, and less lactate was produced by insulin-deficient muscle (P less than 0.05), the differences in venous blood pH appeared to be brought about mainly by a different CO2 production of the exercising muscle in the two groups. The response of Krebs cycle activity to exercise in insulin-deficient muscle might have been inadequate, as suggested by the increased 3-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio in the venous blood observed in the normal controls but not in the diabetics. Furthermore, proportionally less of the arterial ketone body concentration was utilized by the working muscle in the insulin-deficient diabetics. Changes in erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate did not contribute to the differences in the in-vivo Bohr effect."

Cervical tears extending into the lower uterine segment or into the broad ligament occurred in 4 cases, lower segment tears in 6 and a fundal tear in 1. One patient died of respiratory failure. The possible cause of uterine rupture with vacuum extraction appear to be a combination of an unengaged fetal head, an incompletely dilated cervix and an undetected mild cephalopelvic disproportion especially in grandmultiparae, dehiscent or weak uterine scars, prolonged traction without progress, manipulations in shoulder dystocia and obstruction and excessive non controlled traction.

      "The urinary excretion profiles of naltrexone in man, monkey, rabbit, and rat. A gas-chromatographic method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of naltrexone, alpha-naltrexol, and beta-naltrexol as trimethylsiyl derivatives. Analysis of urine from rabbit, monkey, and rat demonstrated that, like man, these species reduce naltrexone primarily to beta-naltrexol. In naltrexone maintenance patients receiving 125 mg po three times per week, an average of 37% of the dose was recovered in 48-hr urine as free naltrexone (0.8%), conjugated naltrexone (7.6%), free beta-naltrexol (16.8%), and conjugated beta-naltrexol (11.8%). Thirty-four percent of the dose appeared in 0-24 hr and 3% during 24-48 hr. The ratio of beta-naltrexol to naltrexone rose from 2 at 0-4 hr to 34-48 hr. Monkeys receiving a daily dose of 12 mg/kg po, chronically, excreted very little free beta-naltrexol and exhibited an apparent sex-related difference in excretion patterns, with females excreting more than twice as much total base as males. Rabbits given a dose of 30 mg/kg ip for 4 days excreted conjugated naltrexone as the predominant urinary metabolite, accounting for 80% of total base recovered in 24 hr. In rats receiving 100 mg/kg po, less than 1% of the administered dose could be accounted for in the 24-hr urine, indicating that although the beta-naltrexol is produced as a urinary metabolite, other means of disposition of the drug must exist. Thus, in man and the monkey, beta-naltrexol is the predominant and persistent urinary metabolite. Urinary excretion profiles of naltrexone differ greatly between species commonly examined for chronic toxicity studies."

Circulatory regulation in response to postural changes follows mechanical rules, whereby the shifts in volume in the various organs of the body play an essential role. The change from the horizontal to the vertical position is accompanied by a decrease in pressure above the hydrostatic neutral point, i.e. in the cephalic vessels, whereas the capacious vessels in the caudal region are dilated and the venous return becomes sluggish. As a consequence of the different time courses followed by the various circulatory parameters in the wake of counter-regulatory measures, a distinction can be made between an early orthostatic instant regulatory response and a late orthostatic response. Prominent clinical features do not necessarily always consist of non-systemic dizziness, tinnitus, pallor cold sweat and, finally, orthostatic collapse, but general subjective symptoms such as deafness and tingling of the extremities, a chilly sensation and cardiac symptoms may frequently predominante. In the case of development of an autonomic neurotic symptom complex, psychoautonomic symptoms such as general sleep disturbance are observed. Apart from investigations carried out on a surgical tilting table in general practice, other procedures such as the Valsalva manoeuvre, the squatting test and, in most cases, the erect test are performed. Broadly speaking four different reaction types can be distinguished amongst cases of postural hypotension. Drugs with different therapeutic actions are selectively administered according to the pathophysiological characteristics of the individual patient and the sympathetic adrenal counter-regulatory response. Medico-mechanical measures and physical training should not be neglected.",

      "[Non-enzymatic fibrinolytic agents]. Non-enzyme fibrinolytic agents include pharmacological agents which are active in vivo but inactive in vitro and synthetic chemical compounds which when added to blood or plasma in vitro directly induce fibrinolysis. There are a number of drugs with a short duration of action such as adrenalin, nicotinic acid, vasopressin and histamine. Vasoactive drugs probably act by stimulating the liberation of vascular activator. The effect of nicotinic acid is rapidly exhausted when injections are repeated. By contrast, the biguanides and certain anabolic steroids are capable of exerting a long term stimulation of endogenous fibrinolysis. Amongst these substances, phenformin, metformin, ethyloestrenol, stanozolol and a new substance, moroxydine chloride, have been studied. The biguanides appear to be capable of exerting an effect upon the synthesis and liberation of plasminogen vascular activator. The combination of an anabolic steroid and a biguanide would appear to be the most powerful. These various drugs have been used with success in cases of recurrent venous thrombosis in patients with an abnormally low level of plasminogen activator in the venous walls and/or low fibrinolytic activity after venous stasis. Chemical fibrinolytic agents were studied only in vitro, since the use of these substances in human therapeutics would seem to be still difficult in view of the fact that they are active only in a narrow range of concentrations."

A review of the literature indicates a small but significant incidence of fetal-maternal hemorrhage following amniocentesis. In these studies, consideration has not been given to the frequency with which erythrocytes containing hemoglobin F are to be found in the maternal circulation in the absence of amniocentesis. In this investigation, Kleihauer-Betke analysis was carried out before and after amniocentesis. This study confirms previous reports that spontaneous fetal maternal hemorrhage is not uncommon during normal intrauterine gestation and that amniocentesis is probably only an occasional cause of fetal-maternal hemorrhage. This impression is based on the findings that most Kleihauer-positive maternal blood samples after amniocentesis were also positive before amniocentesis. In spite of these findings, and since Rh-immune serum globulin is apparently harmless to the fetus and mother, its use is still advocated in nonsensitized Rh-negative mothers after amniocentesis.",

      "Inflammatory reaction and airway damage in cystic fibrosis. In cystic fibrosis there is chronic infection and inflammatory reaction in the airways, accompanied by destruction and shedding of airway epithelium. Leukocytes migrate into the airways and some disintegrate, liberating deoxyribonucleoprotein that is incorporated into the gel structure of the bronchial mucus. We compared the status of these processes in cystic fibrosis with that in chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis, by examining the sputum raised from the lower airways. Measurements also were made on sputum induced in normal subjects. The results indicate that migration of leukocytes into the airways and shedding of damaged airway epithelium were minimal in the normal subjects; they were significant in the patients with chronic bronchitis, higher in those with bronchiectasis, and still higher in those with cystic fibrosis. The large increases found in the total content of DNA and solids in the cystic fibrosis sputum were due to increases in the insoluble fraction containing the whole leukocytes and particulate debris that remained when the sputum mucus gel was solubilized with mercaptoethanol. Despite the large increases in the total content of DNA and solids, the contents of mucus gel components and of deoxyribonucleoprotein from disintegrated leukocytes actually present in the mucus gel structure of the cystic fibrosis sputum were not significantly higher than in the sputum from the patients with chronic bronchitis or brochiectasis."

A simple and sensitive technique for detection of strand breaks in DNA has been further developed. The method has been used to follow UV-induced excision-repair in human fibroblasts. It has been possible to study the kinetics of enzymic reactions in intact cells, in which strand breaks in DNA are produced and sealed again. Hydroxyurea, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, potent inhibitors of DNA synthesis, drastically increased the number of breaks observed during the repair process. This was probably due to a decreased polymerase activity, which will cause the strand breaks formed by endonuclease to remain open longer. The initial rate of strand-break formation did not seem to be influenced by hydroxyurea or araC, and was about 4000 breaks per minute in a diploid genome, at a dose of 20 J/m2. After 5--30 min, depending on the dose of UV, the number of breaks reached a maximum and started to decrease again. Hydroxyurea decreased the rate of polymerization in the sites under repair. However, there was no concomitant reduction of repair-induced incorporation of [3H]thymidine and no reduction of the excision of pyrimidine dimers. It therefore seems that the action of the polymerase was not a rate-limiting event, but rather an earlier step. It is likely that the endonucleolytic activity determined the rate of repair. As a consequence, the endonuclease and polymerase cannot be bound in a permanent complex. Under certain assumptions, the time for repair of a site, i.e. the time from incision to final ligase sealing, can be estimated as between 3 and 10 min. Essentially no breaks were produced in Xeroderma pigmentosum cells belonging to complementation group A, and there was no enhancement by hydroxyurea. Cells from the variant type of Xeroderma pigmentosum behaved like normal cells in this respect.",
      "The reaction of solvated electrons with cytosine, 5-methyl cytosine and 2'-deoxycytidine in squeous solution. The reaction of the electron adduct intermediates with water, p-nitroacetophenone and oxygen. A pulse spectroscopic and pulse conductometric study. Using conductivity detection, pulse radiolysis experiments showed that solvent protonation of the electron adducts of cytosine, 5-methyl cytosine and 2'-deoxycytidine occurs with rate constants k greater than or equal to 2 x 10(4) M-1S-1. The protonated electron adducts transfer an electron to p-nitroactetophenone (PNAP) with rate constants ranging from 3.5 x 10(9) to 5.3 x 10(9) M-1S-1. The transfer is quantitative (G = 2.7), as shown by conductometric and spectroscopic measurements. In the presence of O2 no electron transfer to O2 takes place, implying that O2 adds to the protonated electron adduct radicals. No electron transfer from the H- and OH-adducts of the cytosine derivatives, either to PNAP or to O2, takes place near neutral pH. It is suggested that the differences in the reaction behaviour of the H-adduct radicals and the protonated electron adduct radicals towards PNAP can be accounted for if different radicals are formed by H-addition and protonation of the electron adduct. The H atoms most probably add to the C-5-C-6 double bonds, whereas the electron adducts are protonated at N-3 and/or 0-2.",
      "DNA single-strand breaks during repair of UV damage in human fibroblasts and abnormalities of repair in xeroderma pigmentosum. The method of DNA alkaline elution was applied to a study of the formation and resealing of DNA single-strand breaks after irradiation of human fibroblasts with ultraviolet light (UV). The general features of the results were consistent with current concepts of DNA excision repair, in that breaks appeared rapidly after UV, and resealed slowly in normal fibroblasts, whereas breaks did not appear in those cells of patients with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) that are known to have defects in DNA repair synthesis. The appearance of breaks required a short post-UV incubation, consistent with the expected action of an endonuclease. Cells of the variant form of XP characterized by normal DNA repair synthesis exhibited normal production of breaks after UV, but were slower than normal cells in resealing these breaks. This difference was enhanced by caffeine. A model is proposed to relate this finding with a previously described defect in post-replication repair in these XP variant cells. DNA crosslinking appears to cause an underestimate in the measurement of DNA breakage after UV."

The treatment response to beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs was compared in two groups of patients with primary (essential) hypertension and different renin levels. Each group consisted of 25 patients and was equally distributed regarding age, severity and stage of hypertension. In the first group (group 1), the mean upright plasma renin activity was 0.8 ng ml-1h-1 (range 0.3 to 1.5) and the patients were considered to have low renin hypertension. In the other group (group 2) the patients had a mean plasma renin activity of 2.1 ng ml-1h-1 (range 1.1 to 5.1) and were considered to have normal to high renin hypertension. In both groups the patients were initially treated with beta-blocking drugs; in group 1 with a beta-blocker corresponding to an average dose of 311 mg propranolol a day for at least eight weeks and in group 2 with propranolol 320 mg a day in a fixed dose for eight weeks. The hypotensive response differed significantly between the two groups (p less than 0.001). In group 1 the pretreatment blood pressure was 197/117 mm Hg supine and 198/120 mm Hg standing. During treatment blood pressure decreased only 5/3 mm Hg supine and 9/5 mm Hg standing. The pretreatment blood pressure in group 2 was 187/114 mm Hg supine and 186/117 mm Hg standing. Beta-blocking therapy reduced blood pressure 36/23 and 34/18 mm Hg, respectively (both p less than 0.001). Pulse rates fell significantly in the two groups, both in the lying and standing positions. In 17 patients with low renin hypertension (group 1), a volume-depleting drug was added (spironolactone, 14 patients; thiazides, 3 patients) and this achieved a marked fall in blood pressure levels of 38/16 mm Hg supine and 37/19 mm Hg standing (both p less than 0.001). These results suggest the following: (1) Most patients with normal to high plasma renin activity respond well to moderate doses of propranolol. (2) Propranolol given in the same doses is almost without antihypertensive effect in patients with low renin hypertension. (3) A volume factor may be operating in patients with low renin hypertension since a hypotensive effect is demonstrated after the addition of volume-depleting drugs. (4) Determination of plasma renin activity with adequate methods can predict the treatment response to hypotensive agents.",

To assess whether the adrenal corticosteroid 18-hydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone [18-(OH)-DOC] affects urine electrolyte excretion in normal man, seven male volunteers received 120 microgram (353 nmol) intravenously in 1 h. This was compared with glucose (50 g/l; control) and aldosterone (80 microgram, 222 nmol) infusions in the same subjects. 2. A definite though weak antinatriuretic response to 18-(OH)DOC was observed, whereas urine potassium excretion was not altered. Aldosterone increased urine potassium excretion and reduced sodium output. Urine pH was lowered by both corticosteroids, aldosterone in general having a more marked effect. Urine volume was not altered by 18-(OH)DOC. 3. Plasma concentrations of 18-(OH)DOC and aldosterone rose approximately tenfold during their respective infusions. Compared with that of aldosterone, the metabolic clearance rate of 18-(OH)DOC was slower andits plasma half-life was longer. 4.

      "[The effects of dobutamine in postoperative disorders of left ventricular function in coronary patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Apropos of 18 cases].

Doses of dobutamine of 5 or 7.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1 corrected the IC, PCP and TPR. Dobutamine ameliorated the SI and SWILV in an increasing fashion up to a dose of 10 microgram.kg-1.min-1 only and without restoring them to the control values of the pre-operative period. CR progressively increased with the increasing of the doses reaching 126 +/- 21.5 beats min-1 for 15 microgram.kg-1.min-1.

Tests of vascular filling (pre-charge tests) carried out in the second group of patients under 10 microgram,kg-1.min-1 of dobutamine and in a third group under 15 microgram.kg-1.min-1 showed a good cardiac adaptation to filling, equal or superior to that of the pre-operative period. It also appeared that the amelioration of CF obtained with a moderate vascular filling (300 ml of low molecular weight dextran) under 10 microgram.kg-1.min-1 of dobutamine is greatly superior to the amelioration obtained by 10 to 15 microgram.kg-1.min-1 of dobutamine."

Formation of bilirubin monoglucuronide from unconjugated bilirubin requires a microsomal enzyme, UDP-glucuronate glucuronyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.17). Conversion of bilirubin monoglucuronide to bilirubin diglucuronide, the major bilirubin conjugate in bile, was studied in subcellular fractions of rat liver. The highest specific activity for bilirubin diglucuronide formation occurred in a fraction highly enriched in plasma membranes. Studies of reaction stoichiometry and utilization of UDP-D-[14C]glucuronic acid revealed that conversion of bilirubin monoglucuronide to bilirubin diglucuronide is not catalyzed by UDP-glucuronyltransferase, and results from transglucuronidation of bilirubin monoglucuronide, with formation of bilirubin diglucuronide and unconjugated bilirubin. When unconjugated bilirubin was infused intravenously into rats at rates exceeding the maximal hepatic excretory capacity, bilirubin monoglucuronide accumulated in serum and bilirubin diglucuronide was found exclusively in bile as the predominant bilirubin metabolite. These results suggest that formation of bilirubin diglucuronide occurs at the surface membrane of the liver cell. Conversion of bilirubin monoglucuronide to bilirubin diglucuronide may play a role in the transport of bilirubin glucuronides from liver to bile.",

Comparing the values of the examined cholestase enzymes in patients of obstructive icterus it could be seen that gamma GT was positive in the largest percentage of the diseased, (69,6%), then APH (89,7%) AND LAP (86,3%). Gamma GT has shown to be selective test for obstruction of hepatobiliary tract but it is not selective for discovering cause of obstruction. It can be explained by the fact that activity of gamma GT could be found both in mechanical icterus caused by calculosis or tumours (with a very high activity) and in patients with hepatitis with cholestatic component, although in the decresed activity.",

The recent hypothesis that phototherapy is capable of altering the liver cell, enough to allow passive diffusion of free bilirubin from the blood to the bile, and the discovery of substantial differences between the breakdown products of bilirubin obtained in vivo and in vitro, has prompted the AA. to investigate the enzymatic values in newborn infants with jaundice undergoing phototherapy. A study was made of the variations of cytolithic enzymes (GPT-GOT-GLDH-SDH) and secretions enzymes (FA-LAP-gammaGT-CHE) before and after phototherapy among different sized groups of infants with jaundice, between the 36th and 40th week of the gestational age, and with body weight varying from 1940 to 4150 g. No significant alteration of the cytolithic enzymes were recorded and among the secretion enzymes only the gammaGT was seen to increase. According to the AA., phototherapy does not alter the presence of a possible transitory cholestasis in newborn infants with physiological jaundice and causes no significant damage to the liver cells."

Principal features of this syndrome are (1) fever lasting more than seven days; (2) conjunctival injection; (3) changes in the mouth consisting of erythema of the oropharynx, \"strawberry tongue\", and erythema of the lips; (4) indurative edema of hands and feet with palm and sole erythema followed by desquamation of the fingertips; and (5) an erythematous rash. Associated features were lymphadenopathy, pyuria, aseptic meningitis, diarrhea, arthritis, and arthralgia. Although usually a self-limited illness, one patient died with massive coronary artery thrombosis on the 19th day of illness. This syndrome appears to be clinically and pathologically similar to mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, an illness prevalent in Japan but previously unrecognized by American clinicians. Pathologic features suggest a relationship to infantile periarteritis nodosa.",

      "Elevated levels of immunoglobulin E in the acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLS) is a newly recognized disease characterized by fever persisting for more than 5 days, an erythematous skin eruption, conjunctival congestion, dry red fissured lips, reddened tongue, palms, and soles, nonpurulent lymphadenopathy, and sometines diarrhea, arthralgia, and aseptic meningitis. Additional features may include carditis, pericarditis, aneurysmal dilation and thrombosis of coronary arteries, and sudden death. There is a striking similarity of fatal cases to infantile polyarteritis nodosa, a disease recently reported to be associated with elevated levels of serium IgE. Indeed, it is likely that MCLS represents a disease which can progress to polyarteritis nodosa in infants and young children. The paired acute and convalescent serum IgE levels of 20 subjects with acute nonfatal MCLS were studied along with 20 near-age unaffected controls from the same communities in Japan. The results indicate that most if not all subjects with MCLS in the study had an elevation of total serum IgE during the acute phase of the disease (geometric mean 157 IU/ml compared with the control value of 38 IU/ml, P = 0.005). The level appeared to reach a peak 1-2 weeks after onset and declined over the ensuing 1-2 months."

      "Efficacy of antiparkinson agents in preventing antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. The types of extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) reactions produced by antipsychotic agents and the prophylactic use of antiparkinson agents in preventing EPS are reviewed. EPS are classified as akathisias, dystonias, parkinson-like symptoms and tardive dyskinesia, and have a varied incidence reported to range from 10.6 to 100%. Incidence may vary with age, gender, drug and dosage. The prophylactic use of antiparkinson agents to prevent EPS is controversial. Many psychiatrists believe the effect of EPS on patients is more harmful than the side effects of anticholinergics, whereas others believe that because of side effects, increased cost, greater risk to tardive dyskinesia and improper use, the use of antiparkinson agents cannot be justified. Most studies of prophylactic use of antiparkinson agents have lacked adequate control groups, adequate blinding procedures for investigators rating EPS, uniform definitions of EPS, random sampling and careful reporting of group characteristics such as dosage and drugs received. There is a lack of definitive studies of the value of antiparkinson agents in preventing the occurrence of EPS in patients receiving antipsychotics. A large, multicenter study should be undertaken to resolve the issue."

      "Immunological studies of T-cell receptors. II. Limited polymorphism of idiotypic determinants on T-cell receptors specific for major histocompatibility complex alloantigens. These studies explore the extent of genetic polymorphism in the expression of anti-MHC receptors by T cells in different strains of rats. This question was approached with the use of the model of specifically induced GVH resistance in F1 rats which has been shown to reflect a specific T-cell mediated immune response against parental strain T cell anti-MHC receptors specific for host alloantigens. When A/B F1 rats derived from MHC incompatibile matings are immunized with lymphocytes from one parental strain (A they display a specific resistance to anti-B GVH reactivity caused by T cells from that parental strain, but not anti-AGVH reactions from the other. In addition, they resist anti-B GHV reactivity by T cells from third-party donors (C, D, E,...), a finding taken to indicate that the idiotypes of anti-MHC receptors on T cells, recognized by other T cells, show little or no polymorphism. This conclusion suggests that anti-MHC receptors are shared in the species and may be encoded, at least partially, by germ-line genes.",
      "Fibrinolytic activity of menstrual blood in normal and menorrhagic women and in women wearing the Lippes Loop and the Cu-T (200). Assessment was made of the fibrinolytic activity in menstrual and peripheral blood of 30 normally menstruating and 30 menorrhagic patients and of 30 women wearing Lippes Loops and 15 wearing CU-T (200)s. Assessment was performed by measuring the area of lysis on heated and unheated fibrin plates. Also, histochemical identification of fibrin fibrils in the menstrual endometrium was performed by Mallory's phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin method. Results in the normally menstruating group were compared to those of the menorrhagic women, and together these were compared with results in the groups of women wearing intrauterine devices. The fibrinolytic activity in menstrual blood was significantly increased in menorrhagic patients compared to that in normally menstruating patients, but no significant difference was detected in the plasma of either group. The histochemical study of the normally menstruating endometrium revealed dense intravascular and extravascular deposits of fibrin. Less dense intravascular fibrin deposits, but no extravascular ones, were present in the menorrhagic patients. The increase in the fibrinolytic activity of menstrual blood and the decrease in the density of fibrin deposits in the menstrual endometrium of the menorrhagic women were thus associated and were probably involved in the excessive menstrual loss. The fibrinolytic activity of menstrual blood in women wearing Lippes Loops was higher than that in women with Cu-T (200)s and was associated with decreased density of fibrin fibrils in the menstruating endometrium. This may explain the increased blood loss associated with the use of the Lippes Loop."

Numerous \"chèvres de Maradi\" are bred in Republique du Niger (cap. Niamey), 2 - 10(+6) numbered in 1973. This rustic ruminant is often very parasitized by intestinal nematodes and sporozoa. The most frequent genera are Bunostomum (55%), Trichostrongylus (40%), Strongyloides (27%), Oesophagostomum and Haemonchus (20%), sometimes Moniezia or Stilesia, coccidiosis being endemic and very pathogenic, Eimeria (70%). Polyparasitism is a \"modus vivendi\" between the host and these various parasites. All modification of the number or the kind of parasites (prevalence of one or two genera) involves a variation of the differential leucocyte count (anthelmintic cure for example). When the normal leucocyte count is 18 to 22 - 10(+3) per mm3, whose neutrophils: 40.73%; acidophils: 2%; basophils: 0.28%; monocytes: 11.28%; lymphocytes (small and big forms): 45.71%, a tapeworm parasitism by adults (Moniezia or Stilesia) or by peritoneal larvae (Cysticercus sp.) involves a light eosinophilia (8%), in morbid cases of coccidiosis, neutrophilia prevails (70%), and a polyparasitism with nematodes and Eimeria is characterized by monocytosis and neutrophilia, the polynuclear eosinophils being very rare. These observations show the necessity to elaborate simultaneously two cures: the first with an anthelmintic product, the second against coccidia, to avoid an uncertain Eimeria proliferation after the nematode destruction. In African breeding conditions, where polyparasitism is very frequent, such a therapeutic schedule is recommended.",

Gamma GT has shown to be selective test for obstruction of hepatobiliary tract but it is not selective for discovering cause of obstruction. It can be explained by the fact that activity of gamma GT could be found both in mechanical icterus caused by calculosis or tumours (with a very high activity) and in patients with hepatitis with cholestatic component, although in the decresed activity."

      "Factors affecting the incidence and anti-salmonella activity of the anaerobic caecal flora of the young chick. Thirty-two different types of anaerobic bacteria isolated from chickens have been tested for anti-salmonella activity in vitro. Under the conditions of the test only Bacteroides hypermegas and a Bifidobacterium sp. were shown to inhibit the salmonellas and this was attributed to the production of volatile fatty acids (VFA's) coupled with a low pH. When these organisms were tested in newly hatched chicks no inhibition of S. typhimurium occurred. Possible explanations for this observation are considered. The pH value and concentration of VFA's in the caecal material were determined in chicks from 0-84 days. In vitro tests with S. typhimurium indicated that, whilst the organism would be able to multiply at the pH and concentration of VFA's found during the first few days after hatching, the rapid increase in VFA concentration during the first 21 days would make this increasingly difficult. The significance of the developing caecal flora in relation to VFA production and pH is discussed. Because certain feed additives are known to influence the carriage of salmonellas, the sensitivity of various caecal anaerobes to these compounds was determined in vitro, generally at 1, 10 and 100 microgram/ml. The additives tested included flavomycin, furazolidone, nitrovin, tetracyline, tylosin, sulphaquinoxaline, virginiamycin and zinc bacitracin. All the organisms tested were inhibited by 100 microgram/ml furazolidone; none were inhibited by 500 microgram/ml sulphaquinoxaline. Changes occurring in the VFA concentration, pH value and microflora of the caeca of chicks fed for 49 days or longer on a normal starter diet or the same diet containing 10 or 100 mg/kg nitrovin have been compared. When the chicks were fed on the diet containing 100 mg/kg nitrovin, the Gram-negative non-sporing anaerobes were eliminated as a significant part of the caecal flora. However, the VFA concentration combined with a low pH in chicks from 2 weeks onwards was still sufficient to inhibit salmonella multiplication. Other possibly interrelated factors which might lead to an increased salmonella carrier rate in the nitrovin-treated chickens are discussed."

      "The disposition of [14C]metronidazole in rats following vaginal and oral administration. The absorption, tissue distribution and excretion of [17C]metronidazole (14C-MTZ) were compared during the first 4 h after administration of 10 mg kg-1 of 14C-MTZ either orally or intravaginally (i.v.g.) to rats. Peak 14C blood concentrations were reached at 1 h in both groups. Blood samples collected at 0.5, 3 and 4 h had a higher 14C concentration in orally dosed rats (P less than 0.05) than in i.v.g.-treated animals. About 3% of the i.v.g. applied dose remained in the vagina at 4 h. After 4 h, the plasma, liver, kidney, brain, lung and uterus concentrations of 14C were similar in both groups, whereas the blood, skeletal muscle and fat 14C values were significantly greater in the orally dosed rats. The total recoveries of 14C in the urine and faeces did not differ (ca 38% over 4 h) between the two groups. These results suggest that the kinetics of metronidazole are similar after the administration of equal amounts of this drug by either route.",
      "Assessment of erythrocyte delta-aminolaevulinate dehydratase for outpatient detection of alcoholic liver disease: comparison with gamma-glutamyltransferase and casual blood ethanol. An enzyme temporarily depressed by alcohol ingestion, erythrocyte delta-aminolaevulinate dehydratase (delta-ALAD), was compared with afternoon casual blood ethanol and plasma gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) simultaneously measured in outpatients. These comprised 37 individuals with chronic alcoholism, of whom 14 had severe liver disease, 22 patients with non-alcoholic liver disease and 24 healthy control subjects. All tests distinguished poorly between those alcoholics with, and those without histological liver damage. The highest specificity for alcoholism was achieved by gamma-ALAD; the best overall performance, with highest sensitivity and specificity was, however, gamma-GT. Although there was no correlation between the results of tests in individuals, 32/37 (87%) of alcoholics had at least one of the three tests abnormal compared with 8% of controls and 64% of non-alcoholic liver disease patients. The tests are therefore complementary and may form a battery of tests for problem drinking and its physical consequences."

Numerous \"chèvres de Maradi\" are bred in Republique du Niger (cap. Niamey), 2 - 10(+6) numbered in 1973. This rustic ruminant is often very parasitized by intestinal nematodes and sporozoa. The most frequent genera are Bunostomum (55%), Trichostrongylus (40%), Strongyloides (27%), Oesophagostomum and Haemonchus (20%), sometimes Moniezia or Stilesia, coccidiosis being endemic and very pathogenic, Eimeria (70%). Polyparasitism is a \"modus vivendi\" between the host and these various parasites. All modification of the number or the kind of parasites (prevalence of one or two genera) involves a variation of the differential leucocyte count (anthelmintic cure for example). When the normal leucocyte count is 18 to 22 - 10(+3) per mm3, whose neutrophils: 40.73%; acidophils: 2%; basophils: 0.28%; monocytes: 11.28%; lymphocytes (small and big forms): 45.71%, a tapeworm parasitism by adults (Moniezia or Stilesia) or by peritoneal larvae (Cysticercus sp.) involves a light eosinophilia (8%), in morbid cases of coccidiosis, neutrophilia prevails (70%), and a polyparasitism with nematodes and Eimeria is characterized by monocytosis and neutrophilia, the polynuclear eosinophils being very rare. These observations show the necessity to elaborate simultaneously two cures: the first with an anthelmintic product, the second against coccidia, to avoid an uncertain Eimeria proliferation after the nematode destruction. In African breeding conditions, where polyparasitism is very frequent, such a therapeutic schedule is recommended.",
      "Acidic dissociation constants of folic acid, dihydrofolic acid, and methotrexate. The acidic dissociation constants in the range HO--1.5 to pH 7 of folic acid, dihydrofolic acid, methopterin (N(10)methylfolic acid), and methotrexate have been measured by potentiometric and spectrophotometric titrations. Assignment of these dissociations was made by comparison to model compounds, by proton magnetic resonance measurements, and by examination of associated ultraviolet absorbance changes. For folic acid, the dissociation constants are as follows: N(1), pK' 2.35; N(10), pK' 0.20; N(5), pK' greater than -1.5. For dihydrofolic acid: N(5), pK' 3.84; N(1), pK' 1.38; N(10), pK' 0.28.

      "Absorption and malabsorption of folates. Folic acid is one of the 'younger' vitamins, yet it has attracted intensive study in the thirty years since the identification of pteroylglutamic acid and its polyglutamyl conjugates. The absorption and malabsorption of folates, natural, purified and synthetic, in disease has been studied more than any other vitamin and indeed folate absorption has become one clinical test of intestinal function. We know little about the release of folate from protein complexes, but we have learned, with the help of synthetic radiolabelled pteroylpolyglutamates that polyglutamyl folates are hydrolysed at or near the luminal border of the intestine and the released folate is efficiently absorbed. The rate limiting stage of folate absorption appears to be the transport of the monoglutamyl folate. In disease, and with drugs, folate malabsorption occurs primarily when monoglutamyl transport is depressed. The specific components of the folate transport system, listed in Table 4, are receiving increased attention. The mechanism of uptake is still a topic of controversy but a dual system including both a saturable and a diffusion component would explain most of the data. Reduction and methyl or formyl addition occur in the intestine but such metabolism is not obligatory for transport. The nature of folate binding within the cell and the function of specific folate binding proteins requires further study. At present we have little or no information about the mechanism of folate release from the epithelial cell to the circulation but this step also could influence the rate and specificity of overall process. The tools are now at hand to complete our understanding of the steps in folate absorption and metabolism. Such an understanding should facilitate the management of folate deficiency whenever it complicates gastrointestinal disease or drug therapy."

A follow-up study. One hundred and sixteen patients operated upon for hiatal hernia with gastro-oesophageal reflux and with or without reflux complications were postoperatively examined by personal interview, X-ray study, pH measurements and study of the oesophageal motility 1 to 10 years postoperatively. The patients without severe reflux complications were operated upon mainly with a modified Husfeldt hernia repair and the patients with complications, such as oesophageal stricture and shortening, underwent various surgical procedures. The main reason for unsatisfactory clinical results, with persistent reflux symptoms, was gastro-oesophageal reflux uncorrected by the surgical procedure. However, gastro-oesophageal reflux was detected even in completely asymptomatic patients. It was found that the reflux symptoms were influenced by the oesophageal motility. The clinical results were better and recurrence of hernia and the occurrence of pathological reflux were lower in patients operated upon for hernia without severe reflux complications. Creation of a competent antireflux barrier between the oesophagus and stomach for control of gastro-oesophageal reflux is much more difficult in patients with severe reflux complications.",
      "[Hemodynamic effects of a new antidepolarizing agent: fazadinium bromide]. Studies concerning the hemodynamic effects of this new antidepolarizing agent are scarce and difficult to interpret because of drug interactions, and of an accentuation of vagal tonus related to the use of morphinomimetic analgesics. For a better approach of the effects proper to fazadinium, we have tried to perform a study freed, to a maximum, from any drug interference. We studied the hemodynamic effects to a single dose of 1 mg.kg-1 of fazadinium bromide during 35 minutes in coronary patients normal hemodynamically or rhythmically, non-premedicated, ventilated with 50 p. 100 nitrous oxide in oxygen, and bebore any surgical procedure. All hemodynamic modifications are moderate and maximal 10 minutes after injection. The stroke index decreases 16 p. 100, heart rate increases 6 p. 100 and cardiac index falls 10 p. 100. Total peripheral resistance remains unchanged and mean arterial pressure drops 10 p. 100. Finally pulmonary wedge pressure decreases slightly. None of these modifications are statistically significant. One may, therefore, conclude that fazadinium tolerance, when the drug is freed from any drug interference, in coronary patients normal hemodynamically and free from rhythm disorders is excellent from a hemodynamic and rhythmic point of view. However, other isolated observations of hypovolemic subjects, or patients with atrial fibrillation receiving fazadinium and studied hemodynamically suggest a poorer tolerance in these cases.",
      "Pressor response during cystomanometry in spinal injury patients complicated with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. Herein attention is focused on the documentation of high blood pressure response with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in spinal cord injury patients and with its amelioration after extended sphincterotomy. During cystomanometric evaluation of the bladder the monitored blood pressure response in 53 spinal injury patients, 27 non-dyssynergic spinal injury patients and 18 non-spinal injury patients was compared. A high correlation was observed among the magnitudes of blood pressure increase, level of injury and the severity of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in spinal injury patients. During cystomanometry blood pressure increases of greater than 20 mm. Hg systolic and 10 mm. Hg diastolic in normotensive paraplegics (below T5) and also in non-spinal injury patients were significant to suspect detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. In normotensive tetraplegic patients blood pressure increases of greater than 40 mm. Hg systolic and 20 mm. Hg diastolic were significant to suspect detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia. The mechanism of blood pressure increase is elucidated. The management of this high blood pressure response in patients with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia by drug therapy and extended sphincterotomy is discussed. Based on our experience the use of carbon dioxide for cystomanometry seems preferable in patients with spinal lesions above T5 since expedient deflation of the bladder can prevent an inordinate blood pressure increase."

Glucan synthetase was fully active in cell-free extracts. Small concentrations of trypsin or subtilopeptidase A from Bacillus subtilis, caused only a slight increase in glucosyl transferase activity, but larger concentrations destroyed beta-glucan synthetase. Acid proteases were neither stimulatory nor destructive. Thus it seems unlikely that beta-glucan synthetase exists in a zymogen form. Glucan synthetase was unstable. It was inactivated more rapidly at 28 C than at 0 C. The presence of substrate, beta-glucan or the protease inhibitors PMSF, Antipain or Pepstatin A did not protect beta-glucan synthetase from inactivation. Glucan synthetase was not stimulated by addition of cellobiose or beta-glucans. The synthesis of beta-glucans was competitively inhibited by UDP (Ki = 0.45 mM). Glucono-delta-lactone, a known inhibitor of beta-glucosidases was a strong non-competitive inhibitor of beta-glucan synthetase.",

      "Elevated levels of immunoglobulin E in the acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (MCLS) is a newly recognized disease characterized by fever persisting for more than 5 days, an erythematous skin eruption, conjunctival congestion, dry red fissured lips, reddened tongue, palms, and soles, nonpurulent lymphadenopathy, and sometines diarrhea, arthralgia, and aseptic meningitis. Additional features may include carditis, pericarditis, aneurysmal dilation and thrombosis of coronary arteries, and sudden death. There is a striking similarity of fatal cases to infantile polyarteritis nodosa, a disease recently reported to be associated with elevated levels of serium IgE. Indeed, it is likely that MCLS represents a disease which can progress to polyarteritis nodosa in infants and young children. The paired acute and convalescent serum IgE levels of 20 subjects with acute nonfatal MCLS were studied along with 20 near-age unaffected controls from the same communities in Japan. The results indicate that most if not all subjects with MCLS in the study had an elevation of total serum IgE during the acute phase of the disease (geometric mean 157 IU/ml compared with the control value of 38 IU/ml, P = 0.005). The level appeared to reach a peak 1-2 weeks after onset and declined over the ensuing 1-2 months."

      "Urodynamic studies in prune belly syndrome. A case report. Urodynamic studies were carried out in a 14-year-old boy with Prune Belly Syndrome and terminal renal failure prior and after successful renal transplantation. Increased bladder capacity, nonprovocative detrusor instability and a high compliance were the most characteristic findings during the filling phase of the bladder. During the voiding phase an increased detrusor pressure was demonstrated. Outflow resistance and maximum urinary flow rate were within normal range before and after transplantation. In contrast to the findings before renal transplantation, however, micturition was imbalanced after transplantation (residual urine 100 ml). Urodynamics revealed that the bulging of the posterior urethra, observed in the early voiding phase, was due to a congenital insufficiency of the posterior urethral musculature (megalourethra) and not caused by mechanical obstruction leading to urethral dilatation. It is suggested that detrusor-bladder-neck-dyssynergia is the primary cause of the imbalanced micturition and its consequences (bladder distention, reflux, urinary tract infection, hydronephrosis, pyelonephritis) in patients with Prune Belly Syndrome. The findings of a normal, respectively increased detrusor activity are in contrast to the observations of some authors, describing attenutation and absence of detrusor muscle fibres.

The effects of local distension of the intestinal wall on the release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the adjacent non-distended part were studied with the segment os isolated guinea pig ileum. Local distension of the intestinal wall induced the increased release of ACh in the distended part and in its anal side but not in its oral side. Such aboral release of ACh by local distension was abolished by tetrodotoxin or atropine in the concentrations which did not block the release in the distended part. When hexamethonium was applied exclusively to the distending part, significant increase of ACh release was observed in both the regions oral to and anal to the distended part. It is suggested that distension stimuli applied to the myenteric plexus are transmitted aborally along the network of the Auerbach's plexus to the anal direction. The release of ACh from the intestine by nicotine or DMPP differed from the occurring during local distension in that the release was localized to the part of the intestine to which the drug was applied.",

      "Interaction of thyroid peroxidase with concanavalin A covalently coupled to agarose. We have investigated the interaction between concanavalin A-agarose (Con A-agarose) and thyroid peroxidase, an integral membrane protein found in the 105,000 X g, 1-h particulate fraction of thyroid tissue. An intact form of porcine thyroid peroxidase was obtained by solubilization with the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 and two fragmented, hydrophilic forms of the enzyme were prepared by trypsin treatment of the membrane. The three types of thyroid peroxidase bind to Con A-agarose and can be eluted with alpha-methyl-D-mannoside. The alpha-methyl-D-mannoside eluate of the most purified thyroid peroxidase preparation has been analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Peroxidase activity corresponds with a glycoprotein band. The binding of thyroid peroxidase to Con A-agarose can be inhibited by sugars in the following order: alpha-methyl-D-mannoside greater than D-mannose greater than alpha-methyl-D-glucoside greater than D-glucose greater than D-galactose. This order of specificity is typical of Con A-sugar interactions. Furthermore, inactivation of the carbohydrate binding site of Con A by demetallization greatly reduces the extent of thyroid peroxidase binding. Reactivation of the carbohydrate binding site by the addition of Ca2+ and Mn2+ to demetallized Con A-agarose restores thyroid peroxidase binding. These and other experiments suggest that htyroid peroxidase is, like several other peroxidases, a glycoprotein. In addition, the interaction between thyroid peroxidase and Con A-agarose may provide a new purification tool for thyroid peroxidase.",

The animals were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. As the basic effects of the compound can be altered by release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerves of heart and vessels, the dogs were pretreated with acebutolol, a beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agent, which decreased heart rate and prolonged atrioventricular conduction and refractoriness. Nifedipine 1,6 and particularly 30 microgram/kg body weight increased the heart rate and decreased atrioventricular conduction time during atrial pacing, whereas atrioventricular conduction time during sinus rhythm and atrioventricular refractoriness were only affected by nifedipine 30 microgram/kg.

      "Treatment of hemorrhagic gastritis by antacid. A simple and safe method of nonsurgical treatment for the control of massive acute gastric mucosal hemorrhage is described. The procedure was developed from experimental and clinical observations that the presence of gastric hydrocloric acid played an important part in the development and perpetuation of the entity. The treatment consists of complete neutralization of gastric acid with antacid to a pH of 7. The antacid is intermittently added and aspirate at 7. In a retrospective analysis, the hemorrhage was controlled in 44 of 49 patients (89%). Five patients who continued to bleed underwent surgery (10%). Three patients had vagotomy and pyloroplasty and their bleeding ceased without recurrence. Two patients underwent partial gastrectomy, but they developed recurrent bleeding and died. One patient whose bleeding has been controlled by vagotomy and pyloroplasty died without hemorrhage 10 days after operation. Of the 44 patients whose bleeding had been controlled by antacid, 11 patients died without hemorrhage one or more weeks later. These results of 89% control of hemorrhage compare favorably with those in the literature.",
      "Pneumothorax in the respiratory distress syndrome: incidence and effect on vital signs, blood gases, and pH. We determined the incidence of pneumothorax in 295 infants (mean birthweight, 1,917 gm) with the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) treated according to the same protocol. Fifty-five infants (mean birthweight, 1,594 gm) developed pneumothorax (incidence, 19%); incidence varied with severity of RDS and intensity of respiratory assistance. Pneumothorax occurred in 3.5% (2 of 58) of infants who received no assisted ventilation and in 11% (14 of 124) of infants who received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as the only form of assisted ventilation; the difference between these two groups is not significant. Forty-nine infants initially treated with CPAP later required mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Pneumothorax occurred in 12 of the 49 (24%) and in 21 of 64 (33%) of those infants initially treated with PEEP; the incidence of pneumothorax for both these groups was significantly higher than for those treated with no assisted ventilation or CPAP only. To assess the value of frequent measurement of vital signs, blood gas tensions, and pH in the recognition of pneumothorax, we analyzed these variables by the cumulative sum statistical technique. We noted the following significant changes associated with pneumothorax: arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate decreased in 77% of cases; pulse pressure narrowed in 51% of cases; Po2 decreased in 17 of 20 cases in which ventilatory settings were constant for at least three hours prior to pneumothorax. However, pH and Pco2 showed consistent changes. Frequent measurements of vital signs and Po2 aid in the early diagnosis of pneumothorax."

In order to maintain double blindness, sorbitol syrup was used as a control solution along with neomycin and was compared with lactulose syrup and placebo tablets in a double drug protocol. Twenty-nine patients were studied in a crossover investigation in which each received both therapeutic regimens preceded and followed by control periods. Four additional patients received one or the other agent, but did not receive both. Serial, semiquantitative assessments were made in all patients of mental status, asterixis, and the trailmaking test (TMT) and electroencephalograms (EEG) and arterial ammonia levels. Both neomycin-sorbitol and lactulose were effective in the majority of patients (83 and 90%, respectively). Each of these parameters (mental state, asterixis, TMT, EEG, and NH3) was improved significantly by neomycin-sorbitol and lactulose. The post-treatment levels for each of these measures were similar in the neomycin and lactulose-treated groups. Mean stool pH was reduced by neomycinsorbitol to 6.1 and by lactulose to 5.5. This difference was highly significant statistically. Bowel activity was similar in the two groups. Both drugs were free of toxicity. These investigations demonstrate that both lactulose and neomycin-sorbitol are effective in the treatment of chronic portal-systemic encephalopathy.",
      "Lower esophageal sphincter pressure in cirrhotic men with ascites: before and after diuresis. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) was measured in 10 biopsy-proved cirrhotics with esophageal varices and tense ascites before and after diuresis to evaluate of ascites might play in the development of variceal bleeding. In the 10 cirrhotic men studied, basal LESP was 30.9 +/- 1.7 mm Hg before and 22.7 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) after a diuresis which resulted in a mean 12-kg weight loss. LESP responses to abdominal compression were also evaluated. The change in LESP in response to a standard degree of abdominal compression was greater in the presence of ascites (8.5 +/- 0.4) than in its absence (6.3 +/- 0.4) (P less than 0.01). Basal gastric pH and fasting plasma gastrin concentrations did not differ during the two testing periods. Based on these data and the rarity with which cirrhotic patients with ascites complain of heartburn, it is concluded that reflux esophagitis caused by failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to remain competent is unlikely to be a significant etiological factor in the development of variceal bleeding.",

      "Dependence of CSF on plasma bicarbonate during hypocapnia and hypoxemic hypocapnia. We have previoulsy shown pH compensation to be similar in CSF and arterial blood during chronic hypoxemic hypocapnia in man and pony, and postulated that the compensatory reduction in CSF [HCO3] was dependent upon corresponding changes in [HCO3]a. We tested this hypothesis in anesthetized, paralyzed dogs by determining the effects of 7 or 14 hours of hypocapnia (PaCO2 20 and 30 mm Hg), hypoxemia (PaO2 30, 38 and 48 mm Hg) and hypocapnic hypoxemia on CSF acid-base status. [hco3]a was either permitted to fall normally or was held near control levels by NaHCO3 infusion. In hypocapnia and hypoxemic hypocapnia, the decrease in [HCO3] and % pH compensation in CSF were less than or equal to that in arterial blood. Most (51-89%) of the compensatory decrease in CSF [HCO3] was prevented by preventing the corresponding reduction in [HCO3]a. This dependence of changes in CSF on plasma [HCO3] required a concurrent decrease in CSF PCO2, but was largely independent of variations in plasma pH. A minor but significant portion of the decrease in CSF [HCO3] was achieved independently of corresponding changes in [HCO3]a. The contribution of this local mechanism to CSF [HCO3] regulation increased with increasing severity of hypocapnia or hypoxemia and was usually associated with a selective increase in CSF lactate. It was concluded that [HCO3] regulation in the CSF during hypoxemic hypocapnia was primarily dependent upon, and therefore limited by, the concomitant decrease in plasma [HCO3].",

The authors measured regional cerebral 133xenon (133Xe) blood flow (rCBF), intraventricular pressure (IVP), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pH and lactate, systemic arterial blood pressure (SAP), and arterial blood gases during the acute phase in 23 comatose patients with severe head injuries. The IVP was kept below 45 mm Hg. The rCBF was measured repeatedly, and the response to induced hypertension and hyperventilation was tested. Most patients had reduced rCBF. No correlation was found between average CBF and clinical condition, and neither global nor regional ischemia contributed significantly to the reduced brain function. No correlation was found between CBF and IVP or CBF and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). The CSF lactate was elevated significantly in patients with brain-stem lesions, but not in patients with \"pure\" cortical lesiosn. The 133Xe clearance curves from areas of severe cortical lesions had very fast initial components called tissue peaks. The tissue peak areas correlated with areas of early veins in the angiograms, indicating a state of relative hyperemia, referred to as tissue-peak hyperemia. Tissue-peak hyperemia was found in all patients with cortical laceration or severe contusion but not in patients with brain-stem lesions without such cortical lesions. The peaks increased in number during clinical deterioration and disappeared during improvement. They could be provoked by induced hypertension and disappeared during hyperventilation. The changes in the tissue-peak areas appeared to be related to the clinical course of the cortical lesion.",
      "An \"oncometer\" of clinical measurement of colloid osmotic pressure of plasma. Measurement of colloid osmotic pressure complements measurements of pulmonary artery wedge pressure for assessing the risks of pulmonary edema and constitutes an increasingly important reference for purposes of guiding selection of colloid or crystalloid fluids in patients with acute cardiac disease. We describe a simple device for its routine clinical measurement. A membrane, selectively impermeable to molecules of relative molecular mass (Mr) greater than 30000, is rigidly mounted between a sample chamber and a reference chamber filled with isotonic saline. A pressure transducer measures the negative pressure developed in the reference chamber and displays it on a digital panel meter. The sensor chamber accommodates samples of 50 to 300 microliter. Equilibration is completed within 2 min. A control solution of human serum albumin (50 g/liter) is measured to confirm the accuracy of calibration of the system, with reproducible readings of 25.9 g/cm2 within one SD (equivalent to 0.4 g/cm2). Technical simplicity of operation and modest costs of disposables have made feasible the routine measurement of colloid osmotic pressure."

      "[Clinical chemical parameter changes in patients with liver metastases]. Certain biochemical serum parameters: GOT, GPT, LAP, HK, AP and Regan isoenzyme, GGTP, CE, ESR, Weltman test, thymol test, serum bilirubin and urine urobilogen were determined in 39 patients with different localization of malignant processes in the abdominal cavity (stomach, large intestines, pancreas, ovaries). The patients were subdivided into two groups, depending on the presence or absence of liver metastases, confirmed at laparatomy, laparascopy or necropsy material examination. The results revealed that in patients with liver metastases AP, CE, GOT, GGTP, ESR and Weltman test are most commonly and simultaneously abnormal. In patients without liver metastases, those indices are also changed but to a lesser degree, whereas LAP and Regan isoenyzme are with elevated activity in a higher per cent of these cases, than in the patients with liver metastases, being in unison with literature data.

      "Treatment of detrusor hyperreflexia in multiple sclerosis: a double-blind, crossover clinical trial comparing methantheline bromide (Banthine), flavoxate chloride (Urispas) and meladrazine tartrate (Lisidonil). 34 patients suffering from detrusor hyperreflexia due to multiple sclerosis entered the trial and 32 patients accomplished. The patients received each drug for a period of 14 days. The patients made records of relevant symptoms, urgency and urge incontinence and compared the treatment periods according to these symptoms. Registration of the number of micturitions was also made. Furthermore, the patients underwent cystometric studies. The following parameters were recorded and compared: residual urine, volume at the first bladder contraction, effective volume and amplitude of the first bladder contraction. The study showed that the patients preferred methantheline bromide. The entire cystometric pattern changed statistically significant with methantheline bromide, but only with concordance to the patients preferences in 60%. Decrease in number of micturitions and volume at the first bladder contraction were the only parameters showing accordance with the preferences. The drugs caused many various side effects. 12 treatment periods were discontinued due to side effects of meladrazine tartrate. The cystometric recordings seem to be of little use in evaluation of a drugs therapeutic effect, and it is difficult to find parameters which reflect the patients preference of the drugs."

Unlike the other groups with functional amenorrhea, patients with the amenorrhea-galactorrhea syndrome had impaired ovarian responsiveness to exogenous gonadotropins. Bromocriptine treatment resulted in disappearance of the galactorrhea and restoration of the menses and/or ovulation in nine of 18 patients; of these three became pregnant. The effect of bromocriptine did not persist for long after treatment ceased, and permanent recovery was recorded only in four patients. The group with functional amenorrhea included 34 patients who wished to become pregnant. Gonadotropin treatment was successful in 20 patients, clomiphene-hCG in two, tamoxifen in two, bromocriptine in two, and combined bromocriptine and clomiphene in one. Thus, the overall pregnancy rate in patients with functional amenorrhea was 79%. The groups with ovarian amenorrhea inclutients with assumed ovarian failure responded to large doses of exogenous gonadotropins by ovulation and three became pregnant.

      "Study of urinary excretion of butobarbitone in man in relation to the percentage of ideal body weight. 1 Thirty-three patients with no evidence of endocrine disease, hepatic or renal insufficiency or sleep disorders, were classified in groups 1 to 4 in order of increasing of percentage of ideal body weight (IBW) respectively: less than 90% of IBW, 90--120%, 120--180%, and greater than 180% of IBW. After oral administration of 200 mg butobarbitone, concentration of the intact drug was measured by gas liquid chromatographic assay in urine samples collected during 72 h and at three times in blood. 2 A highly significant negative relationship was found between the cumulative excretion of butobarbitone with urine and the logarithm of the percentage of IBW. In contrast for a given weight, excretion of the drug with urine was found to be weakly correlated with the diuresis. 3 The cumulative urinary elimination of butobarbitone was significantly different between the groups studied, except of the difference between the group 2 and 3 of the patients. No significant difference was found between the renal clearances of butobarbitone in the four groups of subjects. 4 We conclude that redistribution of butobarbitone into adipose tissues can explain the obtained results and that obesity modifies the pharmacokinetics of the drug.",
      "How thyroid disease presents in the elderly. Some of the symptoms and signs of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in elderly patients may be mistakenly attributed to \"old age.\" Weight loss, muscle weakness, tremor, angina, congestive heart failure--all signs of hyperthyroidism--are also concomitants of aging. Fatigue, sluggishness, withdrawal behavior, senile atrophic skin changes--all signs of hypothroidism--are also a part of the normal aging process. Although screening elderly people for thyroid disease is economically unsound, the physician should maintain a high index of suspicion of its presence. Laboratory tests must be interpreted with extra care. Values of 131I uptake, serum T4 and T3, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone are all helpful in diagnosis. Thyroid disease is easily treated in elderly patients, and results often are dramatic. Propranolol is effective in thyrotoxic patients when symptoms require prompt relief. The definitive treatment, however, is 131I; antithyroid drugs are difficult to manage. Hypothyroidism is easily treated with T4."

      "Clinical and histological study of coal tar phototoxicity in humans. Coal tars of different origin were compared with regard to their capacity to cause a phototoxic reaction in human skin. The photosensitizing potencies were found to differ. Tars that were partially refined had less activity than crude coal tar. An extract of tar, liquor carbonis detergens, was the least photosensitizing. The phototoxic reaction to coal tar was found to be a two-stage process, an immediate wheal associated with sharp burning, followed by a raised, red, infiltrated lesion peaking at 24 to 48 hours. The phototoxic reaction was completely prevented when arterial blood flow was cut off. The histological findings were prominently epidermal, with strong intracellular edema sometimes leading to microvesicles. It seems a possibility that assaying phototoxic potentiality may provide a convenient measure of therapeutic efficacy of materials derived from coal tar.",

The authors discuss the hypothesis that the spontaneously developing (angio-) immunoblastic lymphadenopathy of man as well as the various autoantibodies and constitutional symptoms accompanying this disease may be mediated by different reactions of T lymphocytes toward adjacent lymphocytes and macrophages, whose membranes were rendered incompatible by certain viruses or sensitizing drugs such as the antiepileptic compound diphenylhydantoin. This concept is based on two different lines of experimental evidence: (1) results obtained with animal graft-versus-host reactions, in which immunoblastic lymphadenopathy, angiogenesis, dermatitis and multiple autoantibody formation are known to be induced by reactions of parental T lymphocytes toward genetically foreign structures of the major histocompatibility complex; (2) experiments pointing to an essential similarity in T-cell reactions toward genetically foreign major histocompatibility structures on the one hand and self-major histocompatibility structures that were rendered \"foreign\" by viruses or chemicals on the other hand; (3) recent findings in mice that demonstrate a T-cell-dependent lymphoproliferation after the administration of diphenylhydantoin."

This is 88.04% of the total female population in this actual period of life, living in Martin District in 1967. The mean age at the menopause was found, by status quo method, to be 51.21 years (standard deviation 4.4), and by the method of weighted arithmetical means, 48.81 years, (standard deviation 3.9). The mean age at the onset of the climacteric, calculated by the same methods, was 47.55 years, or 46.74 years, respectively. The mean age at menarche was 14.6 years. The average birth-rate was 2.8. The mean period of fertility for the series as a whole was 36.6 years. Women with menstrual disturbances had their menopause about 1 year earlier. We have noted a similar tendency in nulliparas and primiparas. We could find no great difference in the age at menopause between those who had had an early or a late menarche. Menstrual disturbances also influenced the onset of the climacteric. It was at least one year earlier than with regular menstruation. Age at menarche and parity had no effect on the age at the onset of climacteric. Women working in agriculture and housewives had their menopause a little later than mean age of the series, whereas manual workers and those in other occupational categories had their menopause and onset of the climacteric about 1 year earlier. Furthermore, single women had their menopause about one year earlier than the married ones.

For two of the 25 patients, cytology was Class II and therefore failed to diagnose the pre-malignant condition; but colposcopy showed a grade 3 atypical transformation zone and the presence of CIS was confirmed histologically. Simultaneous use of cytology, colposcopy and colposcopically guided biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CIS in all cases. The authors recommend colposcopically guided epithelial conization in younger patients, provided the malignant lesion is strictly intra-epithelial, and limited to the ectocervix. Routine follow-up with the aid of cyto-colposcopy remains the key factor in this schedule of therapy."

      "Serum ferritin in haemochromatosis: changes in the isoferritin composition during venesection therapy. The isoferritin composition of serum ferritin in 13 patients with untreated idiopathic haemochromatosis (IHC) has been shown to differ from normal in exhibiting an increase in isoferritins in the pH range 5.54-5.62. A similar change was observed in four patients with gross iron overload secondary to haemolytic anaemia. During the course of venesection therapy there was a progressive rise in isoferritins of pI 5.02-5.06 relative to the more basic isoferritins. These observations are consistent with previous studies showing alterations in tissue isoferritins in untreated IHC before and after venesection therapy and they are compatible with the hypothesis that the more basic isoferritins correspond to a 'storage' ferritin and the more acidic to a 'secretory' ferritin. The studies also provide further evidence for a possible biological role of the individual isoferritins.",
      "Isoferritin composition of tissues and serum in human cancers. A highly sensitive technique for isoferritin detection using 125I-labeled monospecific anti-human liver ferritin antibody for the identification of isoferritins after the analysis of small quantities of ferritin by isoelectric focusing in polyacryl-amide gels was applied to the study of renal, pancreatic, and colonic carcinomas. In all tumors studied, the isoferritin composition differed from that of the corresponding normal tissue; major isoferritins with pl more basic than those of the normal tissues were consistently detected. Composition of purified ferritin from metastases closely resembled the isoferritin composition of the primary tumors. Examination of the serum isoferritin profiles of four patients with cancers did not reveal the presence of any tumor-specific changes in isoferritins. It is suggested that the abnormality in tissue ferritins in the three human cancers studied is the synthesis of major isoferritins in the more basic range, rather than the appearance of tumor-specific isoferritins in the more acidic range."

All measurements, except for the left atrial dimension, were significantly greater in patients with aortitis syndrome than in the control subjects. We concluded (1) that the patients with the aortitis syndrome may have an enlarged or narrowed aorta, a dilated left ventricle and left atrium, and a thickened interventricular septum and left ventricular posterior wall; (2) that the incidence and the degree of these abnormalities depend on the presence of complications such as aortic regurgitation and arterial hypertension; and (3) that M-mode as well a cross-sectional echocardiography plays an important role in the assessment of the aorta and heart in the aortitis syndrome.",
      "Simplified operative technique for the long-segment atypical coarctation of the aorta. Simplified operative technique for the long-segment atypical coarctation of the aorta was described. The main objective of this technique is to gain quick access to both thoracic and abdominal aorta with minimal blood loss, and preservation of diaphragmatic function. This procedure consists of standard thoracotomy and pararectal incision with an entry into the retroperitoneal space. Long prosthetic graft was anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion to bypass the coarctated aorta. The graft is placed through peripheral circumference of the left hemidiaphragm, where phrenic nerve injury is not likely to occur. This technique was successfully applied to two cases of long-segment atypical coarctation of the aorta due to Takayasu's aortitis. Retroperitoneal placement of the graft prevents fatal hemorrhage due to direct contact with the graft. Contamination with transintestinal exudate can also be avoided. Results of the ten-year follow-up of the similar procedure in the literature is encouraging."

      "Treatment of comatose patients by mechanical hyperventilation. In case of cranial trauma, early respiratory troubles either of central or peripheral origin often accelerate the deterioration of the neurological situation. The different values of PCO2, PO2, pH and alcaline reserve measured on samples of CSF in comatose patients prove the central acidosis related to metabolic and vascular disorders in the damaged areas. Our results confirm the correlation between the importance of this disturbances and the severity of the trauma. It is thus necessary to insure patients of satisfactory respiration conditions. The tracheobronchial cleansing is applicable to intubated or tracheotomized patients by an instillation of 5ml of simple or bicarbonated physiological serum 4 to 6 times a day, followed by repeated aspirations and associated to a preventive endotracheal instillation of 80 mg of Gentamycin 4 times a day. Moreover we use controlled respiration which does not modify the gazometric parameters in the CSF but which assures patients a normoxia and moderate hypocapnia with a decrease of intracranial hypertension. Treatment by controlled hyperventilation must be precocious, because the recuperation at the level of the damaged zones is very slow.",
      "An \"oncometer\" of clinical measurement of colloid osmotic pressure of plasma. Measurement of colloid osmotic pressure complements measurements of pulmonary artery wedge pressure for assessing the risks of pulmonary edema and constitutes an increasingly important reference for purposes of guiding selection of colloid or crystalloid fluids in patients with acute cardiac disease. We describe a simple device for its routine clinical measurement. A membrane, selectively impermeable to molecules of relative molecular mass (Mr) greater than 30000, is rigidly mounted between a sample chamber and a reference chamber filled with isotonic saline. A pressure transducer measures the negative pressure developed in the reference chamber and displays it on a digital panel meter. The sensor chamber accommodates samples of 50 to 300 microliter. Equilibration is completed within 2 min. A control solution of human serum albumin (50 g/liter) is measured to confirm the accuracy of calibration of the system, with reproducible readings of 25.9 g/cm2 within one SD (equivalent to 0.4 g/cm2). Technical simplicity of operation and modest costs of disposables have made feasible the routine measurement of colloid osmotic pressure."

This is 88.04% of the total female population in this actual period of life, living in Martin District in 1967. The mean age at the menopause was found, by status quo method, to be 51.21 years (standard deviation 4.4), and by the method of weighted arithmetical means, 48.81 years, (standard deviation 3.9). The mean age at the onset of the climacteric, calculated by the same methods, was 47.55 years, or 46.74 years, respectively. The mean age at menarche was 14.6 years. The average birth-rate was 2.8. The mean period of fertility for the series as a whole was 36.6 years. Women with menstrual disturbances had their menopause about 1 year earlier. We have noted a similar tendency in nulliparas and primiparas. We could find no great difference in the age at menopause between those who had had an early or a late menarche. Menstrual disturbances also influenced the onset of the climacteric. It was at least one year earlier than with regular menstruation. Age at menarche and parity had no effect on the age at the onset of climacteric. Women working in agriculture and housewives had their menopause a little later than mean age of the series, whereas manual workers and those in other occupational categories had their menopause and onset of the climacteric about 1 year earlier.

The coexistence of pheochromocytoma with acromegaly is extremely rare, and the association with extra-adrenal paragangiliomas appears to be unique. Thyroid parafollicular cell proliferation could not be proved by immunohistochemical or electron microscopical studies. The large number and extensive distribution of paragangliomas, ranging from neck to pelvis, is another unique feature of this case. The concept of neurocrestopathy or of an endocrine polypeptide (APUD) cell system may offer an explanation for the interrelation of these diverse growths."

Numerous \"chèvres de Maradi\" are bred in Republique du Niger (cap. Niamey), 2 - 10(+6) numbered in 1973. This rustic ruminant is often very parasitized by intestinal nematodes and sporozoa. The most frequent genera are Bunostomum (55%), Trichostrongylus (40%), Strongyloides (27%), Oesophagostomum and Haemonchus (20%), sometimes Moniezia or Stilesia, coccidiosis being endemic and very pathogenic, Eimeria (70%). Polyparasitism is a \"modus vivendi\" between the host and these various parasites. All modification of the number or the kind of parasites (prevalence of one or two genera) involves a variation of the differential leucocyte count (anthelmintic cure for example). When the normal leucocyte count is 18 to 22 - 10(+3) per mm3, whose neutrophils: 40.73%; acidophils: 2%; basophils: 0.28%; monocytes: 11.28%; lymphocytes (small and big forms): 45.71%, a tapeworm parasitism by adults (Moniezia or Stilesia) or by peritoneal larvae (Cysticercus sp.) involves a light eosinophilia (8%), in morbid cases of coccidiosis, neutrophilia prevails (70%), and a polyparasitism with nematodes and Eimeria is characterized by monocytosis and neutrophilia, the polynuclear eosinophils being very rare. These observations show the necessity to elaborate simultaneously two cures: the first with an anthelmintic product, the second against coccidia, to avoid an uncertain Eimeria proliferation after the nematode destruction. In African breeding conditions, where polyparasitism is very frequent, such a therapeutic schedule is recommended.",
      "[Dependence of diverticulosis on age (author's transl)]. The diverticulosis of the gastrointestinal tract is a widespread senile disease. The dependence of the diverticulosis on age is investigated on the basis of 1 000 proven cases of this disease. The importance of the anatomicomorphological lesions of the organs at old age as its cause is pointed out. The males seem to be affected by the diverticulosis somewhat more than the females, whereas its percental manifestation in the different organs is about equal for both sexes. It prevails in the colon with 48.4% and in the duodenum with 35.4% of all cases of organ diverticulosis. The existence of constitutional associations with other diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, is discussed. Finally, the therapeutic problems of the diverticulitis and their dependence on age are examined.",

The findings were : 1) A significant rise in estradiol and progesterone levels, in addition to LH and FSH elevation, in normal women; 2) A lack of ovarian steroid response in the castrated women and in ovarian amenorrheas, which suggests that the source of steroid response to stimulation is not extragonadal; 3) Significant differences in the responses of the four hormones to LH-RH in the women with central amenorrhea in comparison with the normal group with great variability of results; the steroid response in the presence of a positive LH response might correlate with the severity and/or prognosis of the disorder, a point deserving further study; 4) In anovulatory women with pseudomenstruation, LH responses for the most part normal, and particularly, progesterone responses.",

Analysis of heterosexual development by means of the HTDM questionnaire in 49 unilateral and 57 bilateral cryptorchids, aged 21-40 years, who were examined for sterility, revealed only slight social developmental retardation compared to 184 normospermic men from sterile marriages. On the other hand, examination of sexual activity by means of the SAM questionnaire in the same three groups revealed that in cryptorchids the first ejaculation is slightly later and that the frequency of nocturnal emissions in pubescence is lower. In adulthood the patients with cryptorchidism exhibit fewer signs of high sexual activity suca as repeated coitus on the same day or a high frequency of sexual intercourse. Also, there is an earlier appearance of prolonged periods of sexual abstinence."

      "[The atrial arrhythmia syndrome of vagal origin]. Having observed 18 cases, the authors describe a syndrome of recurrent paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia which was very homogeneous from the clinical and ECG point of view. It was usually found in middle aged males, with no demonstrable underlying heart disease, whose disorder of intra-atrial conduction occurred during sinus rhythm. The condition developed slowly over the course of years towards a maximum incidence of several short daily attacks of an arrhythmia which alternated between an atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Vagal overactivity is the precipitating cause of these attacks which are usually not completely nocturnal. The condition never progressed to sino-atrial block nor to permanent fibrillation. The beginning of each attack, often heralded by atrial coupling with a long enough interval to cause re-entry, is accompanied by slowing of the sinus rate down to the threshold level. The vagal effect of shortening the action potential and refractory period is recognised to be non-homogeneous in the atrial wall, and suggests a re-entry mechanism rather than hyper-excitability. This would explain the usual resistance of atrial arrhythmias of vagal origin to digitalis, beta blockers and quinidine. Amiodarone alone is usually effective because of the prolongation of the action potential which it causes. In 5 particularly resistant cases a good clinical result was obtained by the insertion of an atrial pacemaker with a fairly rapid rate.",
      "Characterization of adrenoceptors mediating positive inotropic responses in the ventricular myocardium of the dog. 1 The pharmacological characteristics of adrenoceptors mediating the positive inotropic action in the dog heart were assessed by the use of blood-perfused papillary muscles and isolated strips of ventricular myocardium.2 On the blood-perfused papillary muscle driven at 2 Hz and in sinus node preparations, phenylephrine induced positive inotropic and chronotropic responses in the same dose range and was much less potent than isoprenaline. The dose-response curve for the chronotropic action of phenylephrine was parallel to that of isoprenaline, whilst the dose-response curve for the inotropic action of phenylephrine was less steep than that of isoprenaline.3 The infusion of pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocking agent, at a rate of 1 mug/min, shifted the isoprenaline dose-response curves to the right, and to the same extent, in both papillary muscle and sinus node preparations. In contrast to isoprenaline, the antagonism of phenylephrine by pindolol was noncompetitive. Phentolamine did not affect the positive inotropic and chronotropic actions of phenylephrine.4 On isolated ventricular strips alpha-adrenoceptor blockade by 10(-6) M phentolamine did not affect dose-response curves to phenylephrine or dopamine. Pindolol shifted the dopamine dose-response curves to the right in a competitive manner and those of phenylephrine in a noncompetitive manner.5 On ventricular strips from reserpine-pretreated dogs phenylephrine and tyramine dose-response curves were shifted markedly to the right and downwards. Desipramine (10(-5) M) which enhanced the action of noradrenaline considerably reduced the myocardial responses of phenylephrine.6 Papaverine (10(-5) M) decreased the threshold concentration of phenylephrine required to stimulate the myocardium and shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the left.7 Raising the temperature from 32 degrees C to 37 degrees C shifted phenylephrine dose-response curves to the right; when the temperature was raised from 37 degrees C to 42 degrees C the affinity of the drug was not changed.8 Other alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants, methoxamine and clonidine, decreased the active tension of ventricular strips. The responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline (in the presence of pindolol; 3 x 10(-8) M) were not affected by phentolamine (10(-6) M).9 The results indicate that adrenoceptors mediating positive inotropic responses in the dog ventricle are of the beta-type and that post-synaptic alpha-adrenoceptors are not involved. Phenylephrine acts mainly by releasing noradrenaline from adrenergic nerve endings and partly by a weak direct action on beta-adrenoceptors."

      "Fibrinolytic activity of menstrual blood in normal and menorrhagic women and in women wearing the Lippes Loop and the Cu-T (200). Assessment was made of the fibrinolytic activity in menstrual and peripheral blood of 30 normally menstruating and 30 menorrhagic patients and of 30 women wearing Lippes Loops and 15 wearing CU-T (200)s. Assessment was performed by measuring the area of lysis on heated and unheated fibrin plates. Also, histochemical identification of fibrin fibrils in the menstrual endometrium was performed by Mallory's phosphotungstic acid hematoxylin method. Results in the normally menstruating group were compared to those of the menorrhagic women, and together these were compared with results in the groups of women wearing intrauterine devices. The fibrinolytic activity in menstrual blood was significantly increased in menorrhagic patients compared to that in normally menstruating patients, but no significant difference was detected in the plasma of either group. The histochemical study of the normally menstruating endometrium revealed dense intravascular and extravascular deposits of fibrin. Less dense intravascular fibrin deposits, but no extravascular ones, were present in the menorrhagic patients. The increase in the fibrinolytic activity of menstrual blood and the decrease in the density of fibrin deposits in the menstrual endometrium of the menorrhagic women were thus associated and were probably involved in the excessive menstrual loss. The fibrinolytic activity of menstrual blood in women wearing Lippes Loops was higher than that in women with Cu-T (200)s and was associated with decreased density of fibrin fibrils in the menstruating endometrium. This may explain the increased blood loss associated with the use of the Lippes Loop.",

In these thoracic injuries suspected of tracheal-bronchial rupture, the anaesthetist intervenes in four early stages: 1) arrival of the injured patient 2) bronchoscopy-diagnosis 3) surgical operation, the anaesthetic problems are linked to various factors, the most important of which are the very precarious cardio-respiratory condition, the lack of information and, sometimes, the lack of time. 4) Post-operative respiratory resuscitation.",

      "Pneumothorax in the respiratory distress syndrome: incidence and effect on vital signs, blood gases, and pH. We determined the incidence of pneumothorax in 295 infants (mean birthweight, 1,917 gm) with the respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) treated according to the same protocol. Fifty-five infants (mean birthweight, 1,594 gm) developed pneumothorax (incidence, 19%); incidence varied with severity of RDS and intensity of respiratory assistance. Pneumothorax occurred in 3.5% (2 of 58) of infants who received no assisted ventilation and in 11% (14 of 124) of infants who received continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as the only form of assisted ventilation; the difference between these two groups is not significant. Forty-nine infants initially treated with CPAP later required mechanical ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Pneumothorax occurred in 12 of the 49 (24%) and in 21 of 64 (33%) of those infants initially treated with PEEP; the incidence of pneumothorax for both these groups was significantly higher than for those treated with no assisted ventilation or CPAP only. To assess the value of frequent measurement of vital signs, blood gas tensions, and pH in the recognition of pneumothorax, we analyzed these variables by the cumulative sum statistical technique. We noted the following significant changes associated with pneumothorax: arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate decreased in 77% of cases; pulse pressure narrowed in 51% of cases; Po2 decreased in 17 of 20 cases in which ventilatory settings were constant for at least three hours prior to pneumothorax. However, pH and Pco2 showed consistent changes. Frequent measurements of vital signs and Po2 aid in the early diagnosis of pneumothorax."

Although preliminary studies with 1 mCi had not shown any iodine uptake by the brain metastasis, this lesion showed intense concentration at the time of the larger therapeutic dose. Four days later, acute hemorrhage of the tumor occurred, requiring surgical removal. Although 131I therapy would seem an unlikely cause of acute necrosis and hemorrhage in these lesions, the association of therapeutic radioiodine and hemorrhage is interesting. Since recent reports suggest that brain metastasis may be somewhat more common than previously suspected, we suggest that brain imaging be included in the workup prior to radioiodine therapy of patients with advanced metastatic disease or neurologic symptoms.",
      "Recent advances in diagnosis and management of galactorrhea. Using prolactin suppression (L-dopa) and provocative (thorazine) tests along with the clomid test the intactness of hypothalamico-pituitary axis was assessed in a group of eight patients  with galactorrhea syndrome. Pituitary neoplasm was suspected in three cases on the basis of elevated plasma prolactin and its abnormal response to L-dopa, thorazine, and clomid tests. Trans-sphenoidal exploration of the pituitary gland in these three cases confirmed the diagnosis. In these cases, however, the commonly used parameters for evaluation of the pituitary gland (skull X ray, visual field measurement, echoencephalogram, etc.) failed to reveal the presence of the pituitary lesions. In two of the three cases, normal menses recurred following extirpation of the tumors and conception was achieved successfully. In the remaining patient the operation failed to remove the entire pituitary lesion and it was necessary to irradiate the pituitary gland as the patient continued to have persistent galactorrhea and hyperprolactinemia. The importance of the prolactin assay, and its response to stimulation and suppression tests for proper evaluation of galactorrhea was fully discussed.",
      "Metabolism of methimazole by rat liver cytochrome P-450-containing monoxygenases. The incubation of methimazole (1-methyl-2-thioimidazole, MMI) with rat hepatic microsomes led to the formation of 3-methyl-2-thiohydantoin and N-methylimidazole. In addition, an NADPH-stimulated binding of 14C and 35S from [14C]- and [35s]MMI to microsomal macromolecules was seen. Both the NADPH-stimulated N-methylimidazole formation and binding of radioactivity from [14C]- and [35S]MMI to microsomal macromolecules appeared to be catalyzed largely by the cytocrhome P-450 to monoxygenase systems of rat hepatic microsomes. A portion of the radioactivity bound to microsomes incubated with [14C]- and [35S]MMI was released as unchanged MMI on prolonged incubation under acid conditions; this suggests that strong binding of MMI to microsomes occurred. A portion of the 35S bound to microsomes incubated with [35S]MMI can be released as 35SCN- on incubation of the 35S-labeled microsomes with CN-. These data suggest that a portion of the sulfur released in the metabolism of MMI to N-methylimidazole is in the form of atomic sulfur (S), which binds to cysteine sulfhydryl groups (R-S-H) in microsomal proteins to form a hydrodisulfide (R-S-S-H)."

Numerous \"chèvres de Maradi\" are bred in Republique du Niger (cap. Niamey), 2 - 10(+6) numbered in 1973. This rustic ruminant is often very parasitized by intestinal nematodes and sporozoa. The most frequent genera are Bunostomum (55%), Trichostrongylus (40%), Strongyloides (27%), Oesophagostomum and Haemonchus (20%), sometimes Moniezia or Stilesia, coccidiosis being endemic and very pathogenic, Eimeria (70%). Polyparasitism is a \"modus vivendi\" between the host and these various parasites. All modification of the number or the kind of parasites (prevalence of one or two genera) involves a variation of the differential leucocyte count (anthelmintic cure for example). When the normal leucocyte count is 18 to 22 - 10(+3) per mm3, whose neutrophils: 40.73%; acidophils: 2%; basophils: 0.28%; monocytes: 11.28%; lymphocytes (small and big forms): 45.71%, a tapeworm parasitism by adults (Moniezia or Stilesia) or by peritoneal larvae (Cysticercus sp.) involves a light eosinophilia (8%), in morbid cases of coccidiosis, neutrophilia prevails (70%), and a polyparasitism with nematodes and Eimeria is characterized by monocytosis and neutrophilia, the polynuclear eosinophils being very rare. These observations show the necessity to elaborate simultaneously two cures: the first with an anthelmintic product, the second against coccidia, to avoid an uncertain Eimeria proliferation after the nematode destruction. In African breeding conditions, where polyparasitism is very frequent, such a therapeutic schedule is recommended.",
      "Histopathology of hepatic acute graft-versus-host disease in the dog. A double blind study confirms the specificity of small bile duct lesions. To test the association of small bile duct destructive lesions in the liver with acute graft-versus-host disease,  a blind (coded) histological study was done comparing liver tissue from three groups of dogs given 1,200 R of total-body irradiation: one not given marrow infusions after irradiation, another given autologous hemopoietic grafts, and a third given marrow grafts from DLA-nonidentical unrelated donors. The dogs with unrelated grafts all developed graft-versus-host disease, and their liver histology was distinguished from that of the dogs in the other two groups by three findings: (1) extensive small bile ductule necrosis and atypia; (2) infiltrates of mononuclear cells around and in ductules; and (3) individual hepatocyte necrosis scattered throughout the lobules. Thus, bile duct lesions appear to be a good marker for assessing the presence and severity of hepatic graft-versus-host disease in dogs.",

The histochemical distribution of gamma-GTP in the liver was also studied on biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis, and gamma-GTP levels in the serum of patients receiving drugs inductable of hepatic microsomal enzymes. 1) After a single intraperitoneal injection of GalN, the lysosomal enzyme activities were lowered in the necrotic areas, but raised in the perinecrotic areas, the proliferative Kupffer cells and intra- and/or extra-cellular eosine bodies. 2) gamma-GTP activities in rat liver after chronic administration of GalN were markedly increased in bile canalicular membrane of periportal parenchymal cells, the epithelium of bile duct and ductules, and som inflammatory cells of portal fields. Levels of serum gamma-GTP were also elevated. On histochemical studies with biopsy specimens from patients with chronic active hepatitis showing elevated gamma-GTP activity, the activity was revealed a similar localization to GalN-treated rats. These data suggested that the increased activities might be reflected on the active stage in chronic hepatitis. 3) Chronic ethanol treatment in rats induced clearly-stained lysosomes varied in size, especially large-sized. The activities of hepatic gamma-GTP were slightly increased in the bile canalicular membrane of periportal parenchymal cells and the epithelium of proliferative bile ductules. 4) It has been shown by histochemical and biochemical techniques that hepatic gamma-GTP activity was increased after phenobarbital administration in rats. A significant rise in serum gamma-GTP was observed in patients on long-term treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. These data indicated that the increased activities of serum gamma-GTP might be accompanied with induction of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzymes."

The higher flow rate was required to compensate the reduced oxygen carrying capacity and to maintain an adequate arterial pressure in proportion to a decrease of hemoglobin value. Perfusion index resulted in 3.0 to 6.5 L/m2/min in this series. When the dilution ratio of hemoglobin became more than 50 per cent and high flow rate was required, however, oxygen transfer ratio decreased remarkably on account of inadequate oxygen delivery and imparied venous return. In these cases, it was difficult to remove the diluent immediately after the operation in spite of powerful diuretic therapy. The results of the present study indicate that the safe limits of hemodilution is 50 per cent in cardiopulmonary bypass at normal temperature in infants.",
      "[Bacterial endocarditis: clinical and bacteriological aspects and prognostic factors]. The microbiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of all (71) cases of bacterial endocarditis admitted to the Hôpital cantonal, Geneva, between August 1970 and October 1974 were reviewed: there was a definite trend towards higher prevalence of acute cases compared to subacute cases. The pathogenic role of S. epidermidis, mostly in cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis, could be demonstrated in several cases. When defined initially by microbiological criteria only, acute endocarditis were characterized by rapid evolution, destruction of the valvular structures (especially aortic valve), and by further evolution under adequate antibiotic therapy: thus, 10/25 patients with acute endocarditis died, whereas the mortality rate in the subacute cases was only 10/46. Many cases in our series showed one or more often frequent embolic phenomena: 70% of the cured cases and 80% of the patients with a fatal outcome. An unfavorable evolution could be correlated with neurologic involvement, cardiac rhythm or conduction disturbances, and/or heart failure; indeed, heart failure due to various mechanisms was the single most frequent cause of death and is presently the main therapeutic problem. Thus, acute infection leading to destruction of the aortic valve and to heart failure still carries a bad prognosis, even if emergency valve replacement is attempted. Finally, 22/30 patients who developed a bacterial endocarditis after oral or urological procedures knew about a heart murmur, but did not receive antibiotic prophylaxis. This clearly shows that emphasis should be put on the elaboration and diffusion of adequate prophylactic regimens.",

The main aim of the present Conference has been to debate that early diagnosis and treatment of cerebral palsy. The Conference was attended by specialists taking care of the child with cerebral palsy (C.P.): child neurologists, surgeons--orthopedists, psychologists, rehabilitants, pediatricians. In connection with the fact that the Conference was devoted to the early diagnosis and therapy of C.P., problems concerning the lower age groups of children were debated. The Conference discussed the definitions of \"cerebral palsy\" used in the literature, the clinical forms, the auxiliary diagnostic methods and their significance in the diagnosing of this pathological syndrome. Early clinical symptoms, enabling to establish the diagnosis of cerebral palsy were particularly extensively debated. In the latter problem particular attention was paid to the diagnostic value of kinetic automatisms of the group of tonic posture reflexes and dysfunctions of the kinetic pattern in children. It was underlined in the debate the C.P. was no separate clinical disease, but a pathological syndrome arisen as a result of the negative influence of different factors and yielding very diverse clinical and neurolopathologic symptoms, according to the kind of noxious factors and the period and degree of maturity of the nervous system in which they acted. The participants in the debate also sressed that, as the child develops and is observed for a longer period it is fairly often necessary to check this diagnosis, as C.P. may prove, as the time passes, to be a degenerative syndrome, a pressure syndrome etc. The psychologists participating in the Conference discussed the psychological problems of the child with C.P. and also the early diagnosis of the pathological syndrome debated. The diversity of the symptoms of the C.N.S. in children suffering from C.P. was underscored, as--apart from dysfunctions within the kinetic area, there can be present sight, hearing and speech dysfunctions, those of sensory perceptions and mental development. These children require multispecialist care, as everyone of dysfunctions mentioned may present a complicated diagnostic problem. Plenty of place was devoted to the discussion of problems connected with epilepsy in children with C.P. Also extensively debated were the general principles of the medical procedure in children with C.P. As a result of the discussion it was decided that children with severer forms of C.P. and those from poor social conditions should be subjected to long-lasting sanatorium rehabilitation. Keeping the child in its family environment should, however, be the generally adopted principle of the rehabilitation of a little child. The parents of the child should be trained in the proper rearing of the child under household conditions, a manner to secure all the needs resulting from the then stage of its development.

In a 5-year follow-up of a case of adult metachromatic leukodystrophy, already diagnosed in the preclinical stage, the development of the symptoms of this disease could be studied in detail: initially, lack of drive, emotional lability and depressive mood. At the same time, pain in the arms and beginning gait disturbance. Later, impairment of memory and concentration, disorientation, inadequate behavior and progression of gait disturbance. Finally spastic atactic gait with small steps and dyspractic components, coordination disturbances with writing dysfunction, fast dysarthric speech, hyperkinetic activity, compulsory emotional outbursts and progressive dementia. Only minor neurological signs such as reflex abnormalities. In the EEG, slight slowing of frequencies compared to earlier tracings. Increasing diminution of nerve conduction velocity in the lower limbs. Only minor increase of CSF protein (51 mg%). In spite of normal vision, evoked visual potentials abnormal, response of optical and electrical blink reflexes delayed. Imperfect filling of gallbladder. No significant quantitative changes of the biochemical parameters compared with the findings made 5 years earlier (excretion of urinary sulfatides, diminished activity of arylfulfatase A in urine and leukocytes).",

The difference betwen the left and right side is bigger in the right hemiplegic, because in the left hemiplegic, the healthy side is more disturbed as in the right hemiplegic. That makes less differences between healthy and paretic side. The variability of the single steps is bigger in subjects with a bad gait. The method is suitable to screen the change of the gait and its progress."

In case of cranial trauma, early respiratory troubles either of central or peripheral origin often accelerate the deterioration of the neurological situation. The different values of PCO2, PO2, pH and alcaline reserve measured on samples of CSF in comatose patients prove the central acidosis related to metabolic and vascular disorders in the damaged areas. Our results confirm the correlation between the importance of this disturbances and the severity of the trauma. It is thus necessary to insure patients of satisfactory respiration conditions. The tracheobronchial cleansing is applicable to intubated or tracheotomized patients by an instillation of 5ml of simple or bicarbonated physiological serum 4 to 6 times a day, followed by repeated aspirations and associated to a preventive endotracheal instillation of 80 mg of Gentamycin 4 times a day. Moreover we use controlled respiration which does not modify the gazometric parameters in the CSF but which assures patients a normoxia and moderate hypocapnia with a decrease of intracranial hypertension. Treatment by controlled hyperventilation must be precocious, because the recuperation at the level of the damaged zones is very slow.",
      "Dependence of phrenic motoneurone output on the oscillatory component of arterial blood gas composition. 1. The hypothesis that respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition influence ventilation has been examined. 2. Phrenic motoneurone output recorded in the C5 root of the left phrenic nerve and the respiratory oscillations of arterial pH in the right common carotid artery were measured in vagotomized anaesthetized dogs which had been paralysed and artificially ventilated. 3. The effect of a change in tidal volume for one or two breaths on phrenic motoneurone output was measured with the inspiratory pump set at a constant frequency similar to, and in phase with, the animal's own respiratory frequency. A reduction of tidal volume to zero or an increase by 30% led to a corresponding change of mean carotid artery pH level. The changes of carotid artery pH resulted in a change of phrenic motoneurone output, predominantly of expiratory time (Te) but to a lesser extent of inspiratory time (T1) and also peak amplitude of 'integrated' phrenic motoneurone output (Phr). Denervation of the carotid bifurcation blocked this response. 4. The onset of movement of the inspiratory pump was triggered by the onset of phrenic motoneurone output. When a time delay was interposed between them, the phase relationship between respiratory oscillations of arterial pH and phrenic motoneurone output altered. The dominant effect was to alter Te; smaller and less consistent changes of Phr and T1 were observed. 5. When the inspiratory pump was maintained at a constant frequency but independent of and slightly different from the animal's own respiratory frequency (as judged by phrenic motoneurone output), the phase relationship between phrenic motoneurone output and the respiratory oscillations of pH changed breath by breath over a sequence of 100-200 breaths, without change of the mean level of arterial blood gas composition. Te varied by up to 30% about its mean value depending on the phase relationship. Ti and Phr were also dependent on the phase relationship but varied to a lesser extent. The changes were comparable to the results obtained in paragraph 4. 6. It was concluded that phrenic motoneurone output is dependent in part on its relationship to the respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition. 7. Information concerning a transient ventilatory disturbance is stored in the arterial blood in the form of an altered pattern of the respiratory oscillations of blood gas composition; this in turn can change breathing by an effect on the carotid bodies.",
      "The effects on breathing of alternate breaths of air and a carbon dioxide rich gas mixture in anaesthetized cats. 1. An in vivo pH electrode was used to assess the effect in anaesthetized cats of the administration of 5% CO(2) (21% O(2), balance N(2)) and air as alternate inspirates upon the time course of the carotid arterial pH, and by inference, the P(CO2).2. This method of administration of CO(2) and air resulted in a lowering of the recorded pH with the production of oscillations of twice the duration seen on air alone. These larger oscillations had a period of two respiratory cycles and their amplitude was approximately twice that of normal oscillations.3. The respiratory response consisted in all cases of an increase in mean tidal volume and ventilation, and in 50-60% of recorded runs, of a highly specific sequence of tidal volume changes. The specific sequence was composed of alternately larger and smaller breaths which persisted while the larger oscillations continued.4. The use of the in vivo pH electrode made it possible to determine whether or not the tidal volume alternation was a result of sensitivity to carotid arterial P(CO2) oscillations. By diverting the carotid arterial blood through a mixing chamber the amplitude of the double (respiratory) period oscillations was, in some cases, reduced but not eliminated. In these cases the specific pattern of tidal volume changes was still present in 60% of trials. In the cases where the pH fluctuations were completely eliminated the specific respiratory pattern was never present.5. Average breath to breath differences in tidal volume seen during control runs with large oscillations present ranged in size from 3.6 to 8.6% of the mean tidal volume. When the oscillations were completely eliminated by means of the mixing chamber the breath by breath differences only ranged from 0.2 to 2.7% of mean tidal volume. The change was highly significant.6. Mean tidal volume and ventilation were not altered by eliminating the large (double period) oscillations.7. It has been shown that the tidal volume is made to change from breath to breath in a persistent manner when there are recurrent changes in carotid arterial blood chemistry. The effects on respiration involve vascular receptors above the mid carotid arterial region. It is argued that the effects involve the sensitivity of the carotid bodies to rapid (within breath) changes in P(a, CO2). There appears to be no significant effect on mean ventilation of the dynamic component of the arterial P(CO2) changes produced in these experiments."

Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) is an enzyme primarily located in the brush border of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney. Its unique localization in the cells most easily damaged by ischaemia and its ease of assay provide the rationale for its use in the measurement and diagnosis of renal ischaemic injury. gamma-GT activity was measured in dogs undergoing varying periods of renal ischaemia and under conditions of local renal hypothermia and was shown to be a sensitive indicator of ischaemic injury.

      "Multiple endocrine adenomatosis syndromes. MEA I and II are two genetically distinct tumor endocrinopathies, both showing autosomal dominant inheritance. Little overlap exists between these conditions, and that which is present can be explained on the basis of two mutually exclusive factors: (1) the secondary consequences of hormone excess on another endocrine gland or (2) the fact that both tumor syndromes appear to result from genetically faulty differentiation of neuroectoderm. A seemingly disproportionate amount of effort has been expended on study of the MEA syndromes. However, there would seen to be ample justification for this interest: 1) The MEA syndromes, unlike most neoplastic conditions, are hereditary and can be readily detected and more expeditiously treated; 2) hormone radioimmunoassay has greatly facilitated diagnosis in asymptomatic individuals; and (3) probably most importantly, study of these syndromes has provided considerable insight into the embryologic origin of the endocrine system. It is conceivable that knowledge gained from these conditions may stimulate further inquiry into the processes whereby neoplasia occurs in endocrine tissue and thus lead the way to the development of effective therapy for a host of hormone-producing tumors."

      "Recurrent genital candidosis in women and the effect of intermittent prophylactic treatment. A study of clotrimazole for the treatment of recurrent genital candidosis unexpectedly showed that symptoms and infection can be dissociated. The aim of the study was to see if intermittent antifungal treatment would reduce symptoms in women constantly distressed by recurrent genital candidosis. Forty women seriously affected by the condition were initially given oral and local antifungal treatment. When the patients were symptom-free and the vagina was free of yeasts, they were entered into a double-blind clinical trial and were treated prophylactically for four months with either intermittent clotrimazole pessaries and cream or a placebo. The prophylactic treatment kept symptoms below a critical level but did not affect the return of the yeasts to the vagina. This dissociation between symptoms and vaginal yeasts was unexpected. Rectal yeast carriage was unaffected by prophylactic vaginal treatment. Male contacts and patients both showed a high incidence of non-specific genital infection. This association has seldom been reported. A few patients cultured yeasts from their homes but this environment was not considered a major source of reinfection. The vaginal pH did not appear to be altered by the presence of yeasts. The results of the study suggested that symptoms in women with recurrent genital candidosis were not caused by yeasts alone, and possibly the reason for recurrences might lie not in constant reinfection by yeasts, but in failure to recognise and remove a primary underlying factor, perhaps infection with other sexually transmitted agents. The question of a synergistic action between yeasts and other organisms is discussed."

Circulatory regulation in response to postural changes follows mechanical rules, whereby the shifts in volume in the various organs of the body play an essential role. The change from the horizontal to the vertical position is accompanied by a decrease in pressure above the hydrostatic neutral point, i.e. in the cephalic vessels, whereas the capacious vessels in the caudal region are dilated and the venous return becomes sluggish. As a consequence of the different time courses followed by the various circulatory parameters in the wake of counter-regulatory measures, a distinction can be made between an early orthostatic instant regulatory response and a late orthostatic response. Prominent clinical features do not necessarily always consist of non-systemic dizziness, tinnitus, pallor cold sweat and, finally, orthostatic collapse, but general subjective symptoms such as deafness and tingling of the extremities, a chilly sensation and cardiac symptoms may frequently predominante. In the case of development of an autonomic neurotic symptom complex, psychoautonomic symptoms such as general sleep disturbance are observed. Apart from investigations carried out on a surgical tilting table in general practice, other procedures such as the Valsalva manoeuvre, the squatting test and, in most cases, the erect test are performed. Broadly speaking four different reaction types can be distinguished amongst cases of postural hypotension. Drugs with different therapeutic actions are selectively administered according to the pathophysiological characteristics of the individual patient and the sympathetic adrenal counter-regulatory response. Medico-mechanical measures and physical training should not be neglected.",

      "[Polyneuropathy due to \"allergic vasculitis\" possibly related to australia antigen. (author's transl)]. The authors describe a case of flaccid tetraplegia due to a polyneuropathy in a man aged 50 years, progressing rapidly to death from mesenteric infarction. As significant abnormalities, the hematologic examinations revealed a very high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a marked leukocytosis and a positive Australia antigen in repeated controls. In spite of the clinical picture being that of a symmetrical polyneuropathy rather than that of mononeuritis multiplex, the diagnose of a collagenosis was suspected. Nevertheless steroid treatment was not given because the patient had a peptic ulcer. On histological investigation many focal infarctions were found in several internal organs but the brain was pratically normal. Instead the nerve trunks examined (the sciatic nerve and the lumbo-sacral plexus) showed gross changes in the vasa nervorum represented by abundant perivascular cuffing and marked evidence of axonal degeneration secondary to an ischaemic damage. In the kidneys there were definite signs of membranous glomerulitis. The pathological findings in this fatal case of diffuse peripheral involvement were not those of classical periarteritis nodosa, but showed the picture of so-called \"allergic vasculitis\". This type of blood vessels inflammation is now assumed to be part of an immune-complex disease, in which the Australia antigen could be one of the causative agents."

We have examined bromocriptine, levodopa and trihexyphenydil ins ingle-blind design in 16 chronic productive schizophrenics having the same degree of tardive dyskinesias. Treatment time for each patient was 60 days: Bromocriptine was given in mean daily doses of 32 mg, levodopa 3,2 g and trihexyphenydil 27 mg. Bromocriptine and trihexyphenydil allowed the continued use of neuroleptics, without necessitating an increase in dosage. On the other hand, with levodopa 25% of the patients deteriorated, and this could not be prevented by increasing the dose of neuroleptics. Bromocriptine and trihexyphenydil permitted treatment of tardive dyskinesias, whereby bromocriptione was clinically (and statistically) superior to trihexyphenydil. Trihexyphenydil had only a slight effect on tremor, whilst treatment with levodopa was ineffective.",
      "A double-blind controlled study of pipothiazine palmitate in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenic outpatients. In a double-blind controlled study lasting 9 months, pipothiazine palmitate, a long-acting neuroleptic that can be administered intramuscularly once a month, was compared with fluphenazine enanthate in the maintenance treatment of 32 schizophrenic outpatients. Before the trial commenced, all patients were being treated with fluphenazine enanthate. The results indicate that pipothiazine palmitate was not as potent a neuroleptic as fluphenazine enanthate. Pipothiazine appears to resemble fluphenazine enanthate in its capacity to induce parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia.",
      "[Psychopharmacological influence on the prey catching behavior of ferrets (Putorius furo L.) (author's transl)]. The prey-catching behavior of ferrets (Putorius furo L.) consists mainly of instinctive behavior patterns, which can be elicited only through their releaser. Then they are performed stereotypically. To get information concerning the central background and the hierarchical structure of this behavior the neuroleptics Haloperidol (0.14 mg/kg), Clozapine (10 mg/kg) and Chlorpromazine (4 mg/kg) were injected i.m. under controlled conditions. In a conditioning experiment the reactivity of the animals was examined. This conditioned reaction was strongly decreased by the drugs. The reaction to the natural stimulus the prey was changed, but not suppressed. The modification of the predatory behavior was manifedsted in an \"improvement\" of orientation reactions when pursuing the prey and in a better placement of bites. This effect, most evident with Haloperidol, is possibly due to the specific neuroleptic component of the substances. A delay in approaching the prey, or even the total suppression of the prey-catching behavior is suggested to be due to a sedative component which was most obvious in some experiments with Clozapine. On the other hand, there are behavioral elements like the use of paws which are not effected by the neuroleptics. From these and other observations, it is concluded, that the predatory behavior of the ferret has a hierarchically organisated structure. Further it is suggested that some functional connected parts of the behavior have distinct central representation, for they are not influenced in the same way by these drugs."

      "4-Aminopyridine and evoked transmitter release from motor nerve endings. 1 In the presence of tetrodotoxin, electrotonic depolarization of frog motor nerve terminals causes the appearance of stimulus-graded endplate potentials. When 4-aminopyridine is added, the graded endplate potential is converted into a triggered all-or-none response resulting in giant endplate potentials of about 70 mV amplitude and 50 ms duration. The triggered endplate potentials are abolished in Ca(2+)-free saline and are blocked by Mn(2+) ions. Sr(2+) but not Ba(2+) can replace Ca(2+) in supporting transmitter release. Mg(2+) fails, even in concentrations as high as 32 mM, to affect the amplitude and the shape of the endplate potential but abolishes it when the Ca(2+) concentration is reduced to 0.2 mM.2 Despite the large amplitude of the triggered endplate potential in the presence of 4-aminopyridine and tetrodotoxin, repetitive stimulation up to 10 Hz causes only a small decline in amplitude of successive endplate potentials. However, in the presence of (+)-tubocurarine or gallamine, repetitive nerve stimulation produces a marked decline in successive endplate potential amplitude. The fall is counteracted when evoked transmitter release is reduced in the presence of 0.2 mM Ca(2+). The results suggest that in the presence of 4-aminopyridine such large amounts of transmitter are released that even during repetitive stimulation (5 to 10 Hz) endplate potentials are of maximal amplitude.3 4-Aminopyridine causes a prallel shift to the right of the dose-response curve to Mg(2+) for blockade of nerve impulse-evoked transmitter release (in the absence of tetrodotoxin). A similar parallel shift occurs in the presence of tetraethylammonium and guanidine.4 It is concluded that 4-aminopyridine increases transmitter release by enhancing the transport efficacy for Ca(2+) across the nerve terminal membrane during nerve terminal depolarization.",
      "Purinergic innervation of the guinea-pig urinary bladder. 1 A number of criteria for considering adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) as a neurotransmitter in the guinea-pig urinary bladder have been examined. In addition, the effect of tachyphylaxis to ATP on the response to non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerve stimulation has been re-examined.2 Quinacrine fluorescence histochemistry revealed a population of nerve fibres, ganglion cells, and nerve bundles in the bladder which were not seen in either the iris or vas deferens, where adrenergic and cholinergic nerves predominate. The distribution and morphology of the quinacrine-positive nerves in the bladder were different from those observed with catecholamine fluorescence and cholinesterase histochemistry, and were unaffected by chemical sympathectomy.3 Release of ATP from the bladder during stimulation of intramural excitatory nerves, in the presence of atropine and guanethidine increased to 3-12 times prestimulation levels. Tetrodotoxin abolished both the contractile response and the increase in ATP release resulting from intramural nerve stimulation. There was no increase in ATP release during contraction resulting from direct muscle stimulation following nerve paralysis with tetrodotoxin.4 Sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine did not affect release of ATP in response to intramural nerve stimulation.5 Release of ATP was dependent on the concentration of calcium ion in the medium.6 Contractions in response to non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic intramural nerve stimulation were closely mimicked by ATP, but not by acetylcholine or histamine.7 Adenosine and dipyridamole reduced the contractions to both ATP and non-cholinergic nerve stimulation.8 2-2'-Pyridylisatogen was not a specific blocker of either ATP or intramural nerve stimulation in the guinea-pig bladder. 2-Substituted imidazolines initiated spontaneous activity making it impossible to assess any blocking action that they may have had.9 Prostaglandins (E(1), E(2) and F(2alpha)) gave weak, slow contractions and an increase in spontaneous activity. Both the response to ATP and non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerve stimulation were greatly potentiated in the presence of prostaglandins.10 In the presence of indomethacin the response to non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerve stimulation was virtually abolished following desensitization to ATP."

      "Partial purification and properties of Enterobacter cloacae heat-stable enterotoxin. Cell free preparations of the whole-cell lysate and ultrafiltration (UF) fractions of broth cultures of a strain of Enterobacter cloacae, isolated from a Puerto Rican with tropical sprue, were assayed for their ability to induce in vivo net water secretion in the rat jejunum. The whole-cell lysate and UM-10 retentate of broth cultures were inactive. The UM-2 retentate and filtrate were active at a concentration of 100 mug/ml or more; the toxigenic activity was entirely retained, and increased to 1 mug/ml, by a UM-05 membrane; washing this retentate yielded a fraction with an activity of 10 ng/ml. Stationary aerobic culture conditions yielded the most active UF fractions when ammonium sulfate was used as the precipitating agent, whereas anaerobic culture conditions produced the most active fractions in broth cultures precipitated by acetone. Passage of the active acetone-precipitated UF fractions through a Sephadex G-25 column yielded eluate pools with enhanced toxigenic activity in, or adjacent to, the void volume, but maximum activity of the ammonium sulfate-precipitated UM-05 retentate eluated at a Kav of 0.38 to 0.52. Neither of the most active gel filtration elution fractions of the UM-05 retentates contained detectable carbohydrate, suggesting that the toxin is not associated with endotoxin. Toxigenic activity was unaltered by exposure to a temperature of 100C for 30 min, lowering the pH to 1, or incubation with either Pronase or trypsin.

      "The glucose-pH relationship in parapneumonic effusions. Both a low pleural fluid glucose concentration and pleural fluid acidosis are markers of severe pleural inflammation, but the relationship between these phenomena has not been defined clearly. Therefore, we measured simultaneous pleural fluid glucose concentrations and pH in 25 consecutive parapneumonic pleural fluids. Seventeen effusions had a glucose concentration greater than 60 mg/dl (group 1, 126 +/- 7 mg/dl, mean +/- SEM), while eight had a pleural fluid glucose less than 60 mg/dl (group 2, 15 +/- 3 mg/dl, P less than .01). Pleural fluid pH was 7.35 +/- 0.03 in group 1 compared with 6.83 +/- 0.09 in group 2 (P less than .01). A significant correlation between pleural fluid glucose and pH was found (r = .81, P less than .01). Low-glucose, low-pH effusions were complicated (either loculated or empyemas). Uncomplicated effusions had glucose concentrations greater than 60 mg/dl and a pleural fluid pH greater than 7.30. The concomitant occurrence of low pleural fluid glucose and pH suggests that the mechanisms leading to these phenomena are interrelated."

      "Selective induction of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase by nerve growth factor: comparison between adrenal medulla and sympathetic ganglia of adult and newborn rats. Administration of NGF to newborn and adult rats elicits a selective increase in TH and DBH both in sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla. This effect does not depend on intact preganglionic cholinergic fibers. The augmented enzyme activity results from enhanced enzyme synthesis since it can be abolished by cycloheximide and NGF has been shown to enhance the incorporation of [3H]leucine into DBH molecules. The responsiveness of the adrenal medulla to NGF is also supported by light and electron microscopic autoradiograms which show that intravenously injected 125I-NGF is accumulated with high selectivity in adrenal chromaffin as compared to adjacent adrenal cortical cells. In spite of the many similarities between the response of the adrenergic neurons and adrenal chromaffin cells to NGF, there are also two distinct differences. (a) In newborn rats the ratio between the TH increase effected by a single and 10 subsequent daily injections of NGF is 1:2 in the adrenal medulla and 1:7 in the superior cervical ganglia. (b) If adrenal medullae are transferred to organ culture after intravenous injection of NGF, maximal TH response is initiated 60-90 min after NGF administration. In superior cervical ganglia only a half-maximal response is initiated at that time. After a stationary phase a second increase starts after about 6 h to reach the maximum after 12 h. The biphasic time course of the initiation of TH induction by NGF in sympathetic ganglia is in agreement with the time course of 125I-NGF accumulation after intravenous injection27 reflecting the moiety of NGF reaching the cell bodies of the adrenergic neurons directly by the blood stream (initial accumulation) and by retrograde axonal transport (second phase).",

Mathematical analysis and computer simulations show that temporal variation in the number of eligible or filled release sites and either spatial or temporal variation in the probability of release at a site can drastically bias such estimates, while the experimental histograms remain statistically indistinguishable from those predicted by the binomial law. Interpretation of the estimates n and p in terms of ultrastructural or physiological characteristics of the nerve terminal is liable to significant error if departures from the binomial assumptions are not suitably assessed."

It has been suggested previously that chlorpropamide and other hypoglycemic sulfonylureas interfere with hepatic triglyceride breakdown. Since ketogenesis from endogenous hepatic lipid stores is a measure of hepatic triglyceride hydrolysis, ketogenesis derived from endogenous lipids as well as ketogenesis derived from exogenously added isotopic oleate was determined in isolated hepatocytes from fasted rats in an attempt to identify the nature of the direct effects of sulfonylureas on hepatic lipid metabolism. Ketogenesis from endogenous lipids was inhibited by 1 mM chlorpropamide, while ketone production from exogenous oleate did not change. The effect of chlorpropamide on hepatic triglyceride metabolism was further studied in the isolated perfused liver of normal rats in the presence of a continuous [3H]oleate infusion and in isolated liver cells incubated in the presence of [3H]oleate. In liver perfusion experiments, 1 mM chlorpropamide enhanced the incorporation of tritium into triglycerides (but not other lipid classes) and increased both liver triglyceride content and triglyceride secretion. Using isolated cells similar effects could be demonstrated at 0.5 mM chlorpropamide. Chlorpropamide, tolbutamide, and carbutamide, all of which inhibited endogenous ketogenesis in isolated liver cells, also inhibited lysosomal triglyceride lipase activity in rat liver homogenates. The drugs were not inhibitory towards alkaline lipase activity. Demethylglycodiazin (2-benzolsulfonamid--5-(beta-hydroxyethoxy)-pyrimidin), which did not inhibit endogenous ketogenesis in isolated liver cells, did not affect lysosomal lipase activity. The lysosomotropic drug chloroquine was markedly antiketogenic when tested in liver cells. The reduction in endogenous ketogenesis, the enhanced accumulation of liver triglycerides, and the stimulation of hepatic triglyceride output by chlorpropamide are ascribed to an interference of the drug with hepatic triglyceride breakdown. The present results also suggest that the lysosomes play a significant role in hepatic lipolysis.",
      "[Hormone and metabolic profile in diabetic hyperosomolar coma. Plasma insulin response to intravenous tolbutamide (author's transl)]. Fifteen patients with non-ketotic hyperosmolar diabetic coma were investigated and compared with ketoacidotic patients. Basal plasma insulin levels were low in all patients (14.8 +/- 1.0 micronU/ml in hyperosmolar coma, 11.0 +/- 1.3 in keto-acidosis), but insulin level increased after intravenous tolbutamide (between 30 and 105 micronU/ml) in eight hyperosmolar comas. Insulin showed no increase in seven hyperosmolar comas and in none of the ketoacidotic patients. In hyperosmolar coma plasma free fatty acids (1710 +/- 197 micronEq/1), triglycerides (3,4 +/- 0,4 g/1) and cortisol levels (49,7 +/- 9,0 microgram/100 ml) were increased, must as in keto-acidosis. Growth hormone (1,7 +/- 0,1 ng/ml) was normal, unlike the case in keto-acidosis. Plasma lactate concentrations were elevated and account for the frequent mild acidosis found in hyperosmolar coma. In spite of the low peripheral \"insulin/glycemia ratio\", the positive response to tolbutamide in half of the hyperosmolar cases suggests a less complete pancreatic deficiency than in keto-acidosis. The plasma high free fatty acid and triglyceride levels suggest that the lack of ketosis is not due to inhibition of lipolysis but could be a consequence of inhibition of hepatic ketogenesis.",

Stimulation of gluconeogenesis in diabetes was judged by reduction of the redox condition of free NAD- and NADP-couples, by the increase in the concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate, malic oxaloacetate and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activity of the liver. Nicotinamide in a dose of 50 mg per 100 g of body weight caused a marked reduction in the blood glucose level of diabetic rats. An increase of the [NAD+]/[NADN], [NADP+]/[NADPN] ratio, a reduction of the concentration of phosphoenolpyruvate, malate and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase activity pointed to the inhibition of gluconeogenesis and stimulation of glycolysis in the liver of diabetic rats given nicotinamide."

      "Plasma concentrations, bioavailability and dissolution of chlorpropamide. The bioavailability of chlorpropamide from two new formulations (Melitase tablets) has been compared to that from a reference formulation which is currently in clinical use as a hypoglycaemic agent. In both rate and extent of bioavailability, all three formulations may be considered equivalent, providing allowances are made for differences in drug content. With 95% confidence, the mean bioavailability of chlorpropamide from the new formulations was within about 16% of the mean from the reference formulaion, and formulation-related differences were not statistically significant. Although all three formulations were shown to have similar dissolution  profiles, dissolution of chlorpropamide was pH-dependent in vitro. Dissolution was almost complete during 30 min at pH 7.2, but only 40%-60% had dissolved during 90 min at pH 2.0. A peak mean concentration of 22.7 mug/ml was reached 3 h after administration of 2 x 100 mg tablets of the new formulation and peak mean concentrations of 26.8 mug/ml and 27.4 mug/ml were reached 3 h and 4 hours after administration of one 250 mg tablet of the new formulation and one 250 mg tablet of the reference formulation respectively. Formulation-related differences of mean plasma concentrations (after scaling for equal doses of 250mg) were not significant and each formulation provided similar plasma concentrations at corresponding times after administration.

      "Comparative evaluation of six techniques for determining the Michaelis-Menten parameters relating phenytoin dose and steady-state serum concentrations. Using randomly generated data within set error limits, the Michaelis-Menten parameters Dmax and Km relating steady-state serum phenytoin concentrations (Css) and dose (D) were determined by 5 graphical techniques and an iterative computer fit to the hyperbolic equation. The best mean estimates of Dmax and Km were provided by the latter. Assuming the experimental error to be in Css the results indicate that the most reliable graphical technique is that based on the equation Css = Dmax Css/D - Km. However, considering its obvious simplicity and relative reliability the direct linear plot is recommended for clinical use."

Patients received care from either physicians or physician-supervised physician's assistants (PA). The PAs used respiratory illness clinical algorithms to guide their choice of diagnostic tests and treatment. Illness outcome, patient satisfaction, and medical care cost data were obtained for all patients approximately two weeks after the index illness. Despite significant differences in patient population characteristics, illness outcomes were similar, regardless of the provider's educational background. Medical care costs, however, were highest for the physician's patients. For all patients, diagnostic tests contributed about one-third of the total direct costs, mainly because of chest x-ray and throat culture use. Sixty to eighty per cent of medication costs were due to nonprescription drugs used principally for symptom relief. The data demonstrate that the medical care delivered by these physician's assistants was as effective and less costly than the care provided by physicians. Reducing chest x-ray and throat culture use would have a significant economic impact, without adversely affecting medical care effectiveness.",
      "Prevention and treatment of space sickness in shuttle-orbiter missions. Today it is impossible accurately to predict susceptibility to space sickness of crew members making their first transition into orbit, for want of a ground-based validated model of free fall. Even assuming that space sickness is simply a specific designation for motion sickness that may be experienced in orbital flight (and here agreement is not general), preventive therapy poses difficult problems because, for a priori reasons, either all crew members or none should receive treatment. If all receive preventive therapy, everyone should execute head movements in a programmed manner to ensure rapid adaptation to the environment; at least a large minority will not benefit but rather will experience whatever sideeffects inevitably accompany administration of a drug. If none receive preventive therapy prelaunch, at least a large minority will pose two problems--treatment for acute motion sickness and rapid acquisition of adaptation. Trade-offs will involve the identification of long-acting antimotion sickness drugs for use prelaunch that will be efficacious for at least 90% of those going aloft for the first time and the effectiveness of combining rapid adaptation with treatment of motion sickness. The following report describes recent experiments dealing with these problems.",
      "The effect of atropine on the lower esophageal sphincter in late pregnancy. Intraluminal gastroesophageal pressure and pH studies have been performed on 8 nonpregnant women, 10 pregnant women with heartburn, and 10 pregnant women without heartburn. Each patient was tested under resting conditions and after intravenous injection of 0.6 mg atropine. In both groups of pregnant patients the intragastric pressure was found to be higher than that of the nonpregnant subjects. The stomach to lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) gradient under resting conditions was least in the pregnant patients with heartburn. After the administration of atropine, a fall in the LESP occurred in all 3 groups of patients which was most profound in the nonpregnant subjects and in the pregnant patients without heartburn. These changes and the pH recordings of the lower esophagus indicate the adverse effect that atropine has on the competency of the LESP both in pregnancy and in the nonpregnant state. Atropine should therefore be used with caution as a premedicant and preferably combined with metoclopramide (Maxolon)."

Transient contractile responses to norepinephrine (NE) of vascular segments from the rabbit vertebral, internal carotid, and basilar arteries rise to a peak within several seconds, and in the presence of the agonist, reverse rapidly, relaxing with a half-time of 15 +/- 3.2 seconds. In the basilar artery, peak contraction is approximately 25% of the maximum response mediated via the \"alpha-like\" adrenoreceptors and is elicited by NE 10(-7) M. Steady state contractions are seen with higher concentrations. Transient contractile responses are absent in segments from the brachiocephalic and external carotid arteries, and their incidence increases the more rostral along the length of the vertebral and internal carotid artery the origin of the segment studied. They were seen in all preparations of the intracranial vertebral and basilar arteries. There is a good correlation between the occurrence in any particular vascular segment of the transient contractile response and intrinsic tone as assessed by relaxation to papaverine (10(-6) M). The response was blocked by alpha-adrenergic receptor blocking agents and was not elicited by d-NE nor tetrahydrazoline or oxymetazoline. This response may be analogous to the first phase of the biphasic contraction found in many other blood vessels. Since in cerebral vessels the agonist concentration to elicit the first phase is several orders of magnitude lower than the second, it can appear in the absence of the latter.",
      "Picrotoxin- and bicuculline-sensitive inhibition of cardiac vagal reflexes. Transmission in the cardiac vagal reflex pathway can be inhibited by stimulation of the hypothalamic defense region or somatic afferent nerves. A pharmacological analysis of inhibitory modulation of reflex vagal bradycardia was undertaken in the present study. Picrotoxin (0.5--1.5 mg/kg i.v.) or bicuculline (0.5--1.5 mg/kg i.v.) produced a dose-related blockade of inhibition of reflex vagal bradycardia elicited by stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus or branches of the brachial plexus in spinal (C1 or C8 transected) cats. In contrast, strychnine and pentylenetetrazol failed to change the heart rate responses produced by stimulation of the hypothalamus or brachial plexus afferents. Picrotoxin and bicuculline also blocked inhibition of reflex vagal bradycardia produced by stimulation of the inferior olive in decerebrate spinal cats. This observation supports the contention that these agents act in the brain stem to block inhibitory modulation of reflex vagal bradycardia. In addition, picrotoxin and bicuculline lowered basal heart rate in spinal cats but not in decerebrate spinal cats. This observation suggests that tonic suprabulbar inhibition of reflex vagal bradycardia also is sensitive to blockade by picrotoxin and bicuculline.",
      "J. Edouard Samson Address: the autonomic nerve supply of bone. An experimental study of the intraosseous adrenergic nervi vasorum in the rabbit. The anatomy of the autonomic sympathetic vasomotor nerve supply of bone was studied in rabbits by methods of histochemistry, and fluorescent and electron microscopy. Our observations show that the intraosseous vessels are richly supplied by adrenergic nerves. The large primary nerves are located on or about the surface of the vessel; the medium sized secondary nerves spiral around the long axis of vessels lying more deeply in the tunica adventitia; and the fine tertiary nerves form a rich plexus at the outer area of the tunica media. The tertiary nerves have various structures which probably contain neurotransmitter substance--that is, noradrenaline--and function as neuro-vasomuscular synapses. The sympathetic nerve supply of bone originates from the appropriate ganglion, and in the case of the tibial diaphysis it descends through the sciatic nerve and thereafter mainly through the medial popliteal nerve and enters the bone alongside the nutrient artery."

In 12 of these peak inspiratory pulmonary artery transmural pressures (PATPs) were increased.

The relationship between pH and fluoride uptake in intact enamel of permanent premolars was investigated by using: (1) a sodium fluoride dentifrice, (2) a potassium fluoride + manganese chloride dentifrice, and (3) a sodium fluoride solution of the same fluoride concentration. The first part of this paper deals with the in vitro uptake of fluoride from dentifrice slurries and from sodium fluoride solutions of different pH ranging from 7.1 to 4.5. This investigation showed that there was no significant difference between the agents but that the effect of the pH was significant. The uptake of fluoride in the form of fluorapatite was more than five times larger at the lower pH level. The second part of the paper deals with the rate of fluoride uptake (increase in fluoride content) from dentifrices in the same pH range.

The decrease in the microhardness of the enamel surface under fermenting \"plaque\" could be prevented with fluoride. Enamel under a fermenting \"plaque\" took up significantly more (P less than 0.0u) fluoride than enamel under a non-fermenting \"plaque\" (initial F- in buffer: 10 parts/10(6)). The artificial plaque did not accumulate fluoride. Within fermenting \"plaques/, the pH decreased significantly more without flouride (P less than 0.01) than with fluoride. Fluoride combined with sucrose more than negated the softening of the enamel caused by sucrose fermentation, i.e. it increased the hardness above the original values. The diffusion of fluoride through the fermenting artificial plaque was more rapid than through a non-fermenting plaque. These findings suggest that caries-conducive circumstances may promote fluoride uptake by enamel compared with non-caries-conducive circumstances.",

The pH and PCO2 values measured by the Astrup technique were compared in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained using two different sampling techniques: 1) a direct or in vivo technique and 2) the widely accepted syringe sampling technique. In 65 pairs of measurements in 9 dogs it was found that the pH was always overestimated and the PCO2 always underestimated in the syringe sample when compared to the in vivo sample. The equations describing the relationships are as follows: 1) pH (syringe = 0.995 pH (in vivo) + 0.084 and 2) PCO2 (syringe) = 0.873 PCO2 (in vivo) + 0.2. The amount by which the syringe sample underestimated the true PCO2 value increased with the absolute PCO2 value, consistent with the possibility of there being a diffusional loss of CO2 during the transfer of CSF from the syringe to the pH electrode (PCO2 (in vivo)- PCO2 (syringe) = 2.4, 4.9, 7.5, and 10.0 mmHg at in vivo PCO2's of 20, 40, 60, and 80 mmHg). This study indicates that the technique used for sampling CSF is crucial to the expected accuracy of the results and that the number of transfers of CSF during the sampling and measurement procedures should be minimized in order to obtain reliable results.",
      "Optical characteristics of carboxyl group in relation to the circular dichroic properties and dissociation constants of glycosaminoglycans. Circular dichroism studies of glycosaminoglycans including chemically transformed heparins at various pH values reveal that carboxyl chromophore plays an important role in the dichroic behavior of the polymers. With decreasing pH, iduronic acid-containing glycosaminoglycans show increased negative ellipticity near 220 nm whereas the polymers containing glucuronic acid display enhanced negative dichroism near 230 nm and decreased negative dichroism around 210 nm. The pH-dependent optical properties have been utilized to determine the pKa values of uronic acid moieties. The acid strengths of the iduronic acid-containing glycosaminoglycans are inherently smaller than those of corresponding glucuronic acid-containing polymers. Glycosaminoglycans in which the amino sugars are linked with iduronic acid display a very weak n leads to pi* amide transition, or none. The rotational strength at 210 nm of these polymers is largely due to iduronic acid moieties. The CD variations above 200 nm with change in pH do not indicate any major conformational transition of the molecules but the difference between dermatan sulfate and heparin can be attributed to difference either in iduronic acid conformation or in intersaccharide linkages.",

Five adult male dik-dik (Madoqua kirkii) were exposed in a climatic chamber to an air temperature of 45 degrees C. Measurements were made of rectal temperature (Tre) and respiratory frequency (f) and arterial blood samples taken before and during heat exposure were analyzed for pH, PCO2 and PO2. During exposure, Tre and f increased in all animals. In the first 80 min dik-dik displayed thermal tachypnea and minor changes in blood gases. Continued exposure lead to hyperpnea accompanied by a fall in PaCO2 and a rise in pH. PaCO2 at first fell and then increased toward or above control levels. The dik-dik did not display second phase breathing. This observation confirms that second phase breathing is not essential to the development of respiratory alkalosis. The main conclusion of the study is that the dik-dik, unlike another heat-adapted antelope, the wildebeest (Taylor, Robertshaw, and Hoffmann. Am. J. Physiol. 217:907-910, 1969), is unable to resist alkalosis during heat stress.",
      "Rapid, shallow breathing after Ascaris suum antigen inhalation: role of vagus nerves. In five treadmill-exercising, unsedated dogs, we studied the effect of inhaled Ascaris suum antigen aerosols on minute volume of ventilation (VE), respiratory frequency (f), tidal volume (VT), total pulmonary resistance (RL), and dynamic pulmonary compliance (CLdyn), before and during cooling of the vagus nerves. With the vagi warm, inhaled antigen increased VE (mean + 62%; P less than 0.01)by increasing f (mean + 180%; P less than 0.01), despite a decrease in VT (mean - 42%; P less than 0.01). RL increased (mean + 170%; P less than 0.001) and CLdyn decreased (mean - 43%; P less than 0.005). With the vagi cool, inhaled antigen no longer affected VE, f, or VT (P greater than 0.5), although RL still increased and CLdyn still decreased. Inhalation of a bronchodilator, terbutaline, prevented the broncho-constriction induced by antigen but did not prevent the ventilatory response. We conclude that vagal afferent pathways mediate the ventilatory response to inhaled antigen and suggest that the primary stimulus for this response is not airway narrowing.",
      "Effects of excitatory and inhibitory amino acids on phasic respiratory neurons. The responsiveness of phasically active brainstem respiratory neurons to several amino acids was investigated in cats under Dial anesthesia. Four-barreled microelectrodes were used to extrude iontophoretically the putative neurotransmitters L-glutamate, L-asparatate, glycine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), L-glutamate and L-aspartate caused increased activity when applied to either inspiratory or expiratory neurons and appeared to be equal in efficacy. Likewise, GABA and glycine depressed ongoing phasic neural activity of both inspiratory and expiratory units. In this case, however, the dosage of GABA required to produce a given depression was significantly less than the required dosage of glycine. These findings support the hypothesis that L-glutamate and/or L-aspartate may act as excitatory neurotransmitter agents at the synapses of brainstem respiratory neurons and conversely, GABA may act as the natural inhibitory neurotransmitter."

The histology of tooth plates of Sagenodus inaequalis has been investigated to obtain information on the histogenesis of the tissue. The histological mechanisms of growth and replacement of the tooth plate are described in terms of an increase in area of the tooth plate by addition of denticles to the lateral margins of the ridges, replacement of worn dentine at the tritoral surface by basal growth of dentine and invasive growth of dentine into the surrounding bone at the anterior and medial margins. The histogenesis of a specialized character for dipnoans is described, namely hypermineralized dentine, or petrodentine, within the tooth plates. This has placed an advanced character further back in the phylogenetic organization of dipnoans than was previously recognized. The implications of these observations are discussed in relation to proposed phylogenies and previous observations on tooth plates of other dipnoans. It is concluded that Sagenodus inaequalis shared a common ancestor with both the ceratondontids and the lepidosirenids. A sequence is proposed for the phyletic relationship of tooth plate-bearing dipnoans. From a consideration of the features of histogenesis of this specialized dentine, the alternative terminologies are reviewed and petrodentine (Lison 1941) chosen for the hypermineralized dentine and syndentine (Thomasset 1928) as the collective term for the entire mass of dentine in the tooth plate.",

Examination of tooth surfaces following application of various types of power-driven scaling instruments revealed that lesions of the hard substances on the tooth are possible. The extent of the damage depends on several different factors, particularly the pressure applied and the area of the tooth treated. The border between the enamel and the cementum is particulary endangered.",

      "[In vitro antibacterial effects of spectinomycin and penicillin G on Neisseria gonorrhoeae singly and in combination (author's transl)]. The antibacterial effects of spectinomycin and penicillin G on clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were studied. The concentrations of penicillin G at which the isolates showed drug sensitivity ranged widely from 0.011 to 6.25 mug/ml. Some of the isolates were resistant to penicillin G. Sensitivity to spectinomycin was observed at the drug concentrations ranging from 3.13 to 12.5 mug/ml. About 60% of the isolates were sensitive to 6.25 mug/ml of spectinomycin, and those isolates which were resistant to penicillin G showed good sensitivity to spectinomycin. No correlation in sensitivity was noted between the two drugs. Tests for their bactericidal activities on bouillon media revealed that the addition of spectinomycin at the concentration of 12.5 mug/ml or over produced a marked bactericidal effect in a short time while penicillin G exhibited a bactericidal or bacteriostatic effect depending upon the concentration used. A synergistic effect of a penicillin and an aminoglycoside antibiotic was observed in these isolates of N. gonorrhoea as was in the isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Where penicillin G and spectinomycin were used in combination, a simultaneous addition of both the drugs produced the most marked synergistic effect. Morphology of N. gonorrhoeae cells exposed to either of these drugs was examined under a scanning electron microscope. Exposure to spectinomycin at the level of 6.25 mug/ml resulted in almost no morphological change. At 6.25 mug/ml of the drug, however, a roughened cell surface, a bleb-like structure or a state suggesting the loosening of such a bleb-like structure was noted. The addition of penicillin G at 0.19 mug/ml led to an impairment of cell division at one hour of exposure and to cell swelling and lysis with further exposure. At 1.19 mug/ml of the drug, these processes of cell swelling and lysis took place early.",
      "Role of urinary solutes in natural immunity to gonorrhea. Natural resistance of the male urethra to gonococci has not been explained by classical immune mechanisms but could result from antibacterial properties of urine. Accordingly, we measured survival in midmorning urine of 10(7) F-62 T2 gonococci per ml by serial dilutions and plate counts. Fifteen killer urines from eight people all killed greater than 3 logs (average, 5.3), and 13 of 15 were sterilized. Fourteen nonkiller (inhibitor) urines from seven subjects allowed no growth. Killer urines were more acidic (pH 5.4 versus 6.4) and more concentrated (861 versus 717 mosmol/kg) than nonkillers. Upon addition of hydrogen ion, urea, and sodium chloride to urines and broth, pH proved to be the major killing factor, but urea and NaCl were also bactericidal. Susceptibility to urine bactericidal power did not vary with colony type (T2 versus T4) or strain (F-62 versus two fresh isolates). Killing was rapid (0.5 to 3 h) and not bacteriolytic. Escherichia coli multiplied 10-fold in urines that inhibited growth of gonococci. Thus, the bacteriostatic effect of urine may explain why gonococci do not infect the bladder and kidney during gonorrhea. The bactericidal properties of urine may contribute to resistance against gonococcal urethritis."

The hypothesis that respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition influence ventilation has been examined. 2. Phrenic motoneurone output recorded in the C5 root of the left phrenic nerve and the respiratory oscillations of arterial pH in the right common carotid artery were measured in vagotomized anaesthetized dogs which had been paralysed and artificially ventilated. 3. The effect of a change in tidal volume for one or two breaths on phrenic motoneurone output was measured with the inspiratory pump set at a constant frequency similar to, and in phase with, the animal's own respiratory frequency. A reduction of tidal volume to zero or an increase by 30% led to a corresponding change of mean carotid artery pH level. The changes of carotid artery pH resulted in a change of phrenic motoneurone output, predominantly of expiratory time (Te) but to a lesser extent of inspiratory time (T1) and also peak amplitude of 'integrated' phrenic motoneurone output (Phr). Denervation of the carotid bifurcation blocked this response. 4. The onset of movement of the inspiratory pump was triggered by the onset of phrenic motoneurone output. When a time delay was interposed between them, the phase relationship between respiratory oscillations of arterial pH and phrenic motoneurone output altered. The dominant effect was to alter Te; smaller and less consistent changes of Phr and T1 were observed. 5. When the inspiratory pump was maintained at a constant frequency but independent of and slightly different from the animal's own respiratory frequency (as judged by phrenic motoneurone output), the phase relationship between phrenic motoneurone output and the respiratory oscillations of pH changed breath by breath over a sequence of 100-200 breaths, without change of the mean level of arterial blood gas composition. Te varied by up to 30% about its mean value depending on the phase relationship. Ti and Phr were also dependent on the phase relationship but varied to a lesser extent. The changes were comparable to the results obtained in paragraph 4. 6. It was concluded that phrenic motoneurone output is dependent in part on its relationship to the respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition. 7. Information concerning a transient ventilatory disturbance is stored in the arterial blood in the form of an altered pattern of the respiratory oscillations of blood gas composition; this in turn can change breathing by an effect on the carotid bodies.",
      "Physiologic evaluation of the HFPPV pneumatic valve principle and PEEP. An experimental study. In experiments in dogs the ventilatory and circulatory conditions prevailing with the ventilatory pattern in high-frequency positive-pressure ventilation (HFPPV) were investigated with use of a pneumatic valve principle and a ventilator system of an \"open\" character. Keeping the gas input constant the importance of insufflation frequency and insufflation time and the reactions to various levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were investigated in terms of changes in arterial pH, Pco2 and Po2. With the volumes of delivered gas kept constant, an increasing insufflation frequency from 60 to 100 per min gave a parallel decrease in tidal volume accompanied by lower maximum intratracheal pressures and a significant decrease in alveolar ventilation. Also taking into account the possibilities of inducing a suppression of the spontaneous respiration, higher ventilatory frequencies than 60 per min do now seem to introduce any further advantages. Including the associated effects on cardiac output and venous admixture, the cardio-pulmonary and circulatory parameters studied did not show any substantial changes with PEEP levels below 7.5--10 cm H2O. Thus the level of PEEP, which often is part of the ventilatory pattern in HFPPV, does not seem to have any untoward influence on the circulation (stroke volume, cardiac output, total peripheral vascular resistance) and oxygen transport (arterial oxygen content and oxygen flux) in normovolaemic dogs.",

A lichen planus-like eruption was seen in four patients after bone marrow transplantation. The skin and mucous membrane appearance closely mimicked lichen planus. The histopathology was also very similar to lichen planus. The occurrence of a lichen planus-like eruption (LPLE) after an immune basal cell damage related to the graft-versus-host reaction raised the question of the immune nature of this eruption. The correlation found between biological signs of graft-versus-host reaction and the out-break or relapse of the lichen planus-like eruption supports the hypothesis that the skin changes could be a sign of a chronic immune response against recipient epidermis.",
      "Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome in the United States. Sixteen patients with an unusual and distinct symptom complex were encountered during a four-year period. Principal features of this syndrome are (1) fever lasting more than seven days; (2) conjunctival injection; (3) changes in the mouth consisting of erythema of the oropharynx, \"strawberry tongue\", and erythema of the lips; (4) indurative edema of hands and feet with palm and sole erythema followed by desquamation of the fingertips; and (5) an erythematous rash. Associated features were lymphadenopathy, pyuria, aseptic meningitis, diarrhea, arthritis, and arthralgia. Although usually a self-limited illness, one patient died with massive coronary artery thrombosis on the 19th day of illness. This syndrome appears to be clinically and pathologically similar to mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, an illness prevalent in Japan but previously unrecognized by American clinicians.

The radiologic identification of mottled, bubbly, and linear collections of intramural intestinal gas distinguish this ominous complication from benign pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis. In the setting of intestinal vasculitis due to SLE or polyarteritis nodosa, these characteristic radiologic features indicate necrotizing enterocolitis. Since corticosteroids may mask clinical progression of the intestinal lesion, radiologic evaluation is essential in the overall management of the patient with intestinal vasculitis."

Blood flow in the vertebral artery and the upper extremity was studied in five cases of Takayasu's arteritis with subclavian steal by use of ultrasonic Doppler flowmetry and finger plethysmography. The diagnosis of subclavian steal was made by observation of flow reversal in the vertebral artery on the subclavian steal side during grip exercise and, in addition, the vertebral flow change with brachial artery occlusion. The blood flow increase of both internal cartotid and non-affected (non-subclavian steal side) vertebral arteries during a common carotid compression was almost normal in patients with Takayasu's arteritis in this study. During carotid compression on the side of the subclavian steal, ipsilateral vertebral blood flow greatly decreased, and the amplitude the ipsilateral finger plethysmogram decreased slightly or moderately. It is suggested that there are significantly important factors in suppressing sumptoms of vertebrobasilar ischemia in these patients with Takayasu's arteritis with subclavian steal. These factors are believed to be (1) good function of the circle of Willis, (2) good blood supply to the brain stem, and (3) collateral circulation to the distal subclavian artery not via the vertebral artery.",
      "[Doppler ultrasonic measurement for diagnosing carotid occlusions and stenoses (author's transl)]. Doppler ultrasonic measurements were performed in 74 patients suffering from cerebrovascular disorders. Flow direction was determined in the supratrochlear artery by using a directional Doppler sonographic instrument according to the method of Keller et al. 15 patients presented, unilateral or bilateral, with a flow reversal (i.e. direction of flow into the orbita via supratrochlear artery). In 8 of these patients carotis or aoitic arch angiographies were performed and in 4 cases necropsy reports were available. In all instances where flow reversal occurred severe carotid stenoses or occlusions were demonstrable. Thus 9 internal carotid occlusions, 1 common carotid occlusion, and 3 severe internal carotid stenoses were proved. One internal carotid occlusion and 3 internal carotid stenoses were operated on. Check-up sonograms after endarterectomy of carotid occlusions or stenoses showed a normal antegrade flow thus demonstrating patency of the carotid vessels. Obviously, supratrochlear flow reversal as measured by ultrasonic technique signals ipsilateral carotid vessel occlusion or stenoses. Furthermore, the method seems to be a reliable means for controlling carotid endarterectomy."

The histology of tooth plates of Sagenodus inaequalis has been investigated to obtain information on the histogenesis of the tissue. The histological mechanisms of growth and replacement of the tooth plate are described in terms of an increase in area of the tooth plate by addition of denticles to the lateral margins of the ridges, replacement of worn dentine at the tritoral surface by basal growth of dentine and invasive growth of dentine into the surrounding bone at the anterior and medial margins. The histogenesis of a specialized character for dipnoans is described, namely hypermineralized dentine, or petrodentine, within the tooth plates. This has placed an advanced character further back in the phylogenetic organization of dipnoans than was previously recognized. The implications of these observations are discussed in relation to proposed phylogenies and previous observations on tooth plates of other dipnoans. It is concluded that Sagenodus inaequalis shared a common ancestor with both the ceratondontids and the lepidosirenids. A sequence is proposed for the phyletic relationship of tooth plate-bearing dipnoans. From a consideration of the features of histogenesis of this specialized dentine, the alternative terminologies are reviewed and petrodentine (Lison 1941) chosen for the hypermineralized dentine and syndentine (Thomasset 1928) as the collective term for the entire mass of dentine in the tooth plate.",

The oxygen-binding characteristics of the three extracellular haemoglobins of brine shrimp (Artemia salina) were studied in vitro by using highly purified preparations. Haemoglobin I is induced last in the development of brine shrimps when functional gills are formed. It has the lowest oxygen affinity (p(50) 5.34mmHg), an intermediate Bohr effect (ø -0.09 at 20 degrees C) above pH8 and a temperature-sensitivity (DeltaH -44.8 to -45.6kJ/mol at pH8-9) comparable with those observed with other invertebrate haemoglobins [Weber &amp; Heidemann (1977) Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A57, 151-155]. Haemoglobin II, which is the first to be induced, soon after hatching of nauplius larvae, persists generally throughout the whole adult life. It has an intermediate oxygen affinity (p(50) 3.7mmHg), the highest Bohr effect (ø -0.21 at 20 degrees C) above pH8 and a similar temperature-sensitivity (DeltaH -46.0 to -54.8kJ/mol at pH8-9) as haemoglobin I. However, haemoglobin III, which is induced second several hours after the induction of haemoglobin II but disappearing from the haemolymph in the middle of adult life, has the highest oxygen affinity (p(50) 1.8mmHg), the lowest Bohr effect (ø -0.03 at 20 degrees C) above pH8.5 and a high resistance against temperature variation between 10 and 25 degrees C at pH8.5-9 (DeltaH -22.6 to -23.0kJ/mol). At pH7.5-8, haemoglobin III exhibits a similar temperature-sensitivity under 30 degrees C as do other haemoglobins. All three haemoglobins have a rather low co-operativity, with Hill coefficients (h 1.6-1.9 at pH8.5), which are dependent on both pH and temperature. The highest co-operativity was observed at 20 degrees C and pH9 for haemoglobins I and II, whereas it was at 27 degrees C and pH8.5 for haemoglobin III. Thus the oxygen-binding behaviour of haemoglobin III in vitro is significantly different from those of haemoglobins I and II and indicates possibly its specific physiological role in vivo in the adaptive process in the natural environment.",
      "Studies on avian erythrocyte metabolism. VII. Effect of inositol pentaphosphate and other organic phosphates on oxygen affinity of the embryonic and adult-type hemoglobins of the turkey embryo. The effects of 2, 3-diphosphoglyceric acid (2, 3-DPG), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), inositol tetraphosphate (ITP), inositol pentaphosphate (IPP), and inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) on oxygen affinity of whole stripped hemoglobin (WSH), hemoglobin H (Hb-H; hatching hemoglobin), hemoglobin A (Hb-A), and hemoglobin D (Hb-D) isolated from erythrocytes (RBC) of the 25-day turkey embryo have been studied. The order of the decrease in oxygen affinity induced by these organic phosphates, at molar ratios of phosphate compound to hemoglobin (tetramer) between 2 and 4, is 2, 3-DPG less than ATP less than ITP less than IPP less than IHP. 2, 3-DPG shows a slightly greater effect on reducing oxygen affinity of Hb-H than on either adult-type hemoglobin. The effect of IPP upon lowering the oxygen affinity of either WSH, Hb-H, Hb-A, or Hb-D is approximately 20 percent less than IHP. The effects of the various organic phosphates upon the Hill constant, n, of these purified hemoglobins is variable but appears to reach a maximum when the molar ratio of organic phosphate to hemoglobin (tetramer) is 2 or greater. None of the physiologically occurring organic phosphates has a significant preferential interaction with any specific hemoglobin. These experiments strengthen and support our earlier conclusion, that the changes in whole blood oxygen affinity which occur during avian development result from the changes in composition of the intraerythrocytic organic phosphates.",
      "[Changes in the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin during general anesthesia]. The well known effects of the lowering of the intraerythrocyte 2, 3, diphosphoglycerate (2, 3, DPG) level and hypothermia, on the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin, lead the authors to study the influence of these parameters on this affinity during general anesthesia. The following observations were made in 15 adult subjects, undergoing prolonged general anaesthesia (average time: 3 hrs. 10 minutes): the dissociation curve of oxyhemoglobin (DCO) by the method of mixing, the intraerythrocyte 2,3, DPG level, the hemoglobin concentration and arterial blood parameters (PO2, PCO2, pH). These measurements were recorded before and after the general anaesthesia. The results were the following: a significant reduction of P50, measured under standard conditions (from 27.64 +/- 1.74 torr to 25.57 +/- 2.28, p less than or equal to 0.01) associated with a decrease in 2,3, DPG (from 0.94 +/- 0.31 mol/mol Hb at 0.64 +/- 0.24 p less than 0.01). Among the factors responsible for this variation in the affinity, it was proved that the volume of blood transfused was of importance as well as a decrease in body temperature during the operation. When the temperature is made to vary from 37 degrees C to 35 degrees C. the P50 ranges from 25.57 +/- 2.28 to 22.86 +/- 0.97 (p less than 0.01). To conclude the authors underline the importance of hypothermia and the volume of blood transfused (average time of preservation = 15 days) on the effects of the affinity of oxygen for hemoglobin."

An algorithm is proposed for solving the stereoscopic matching problem. The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminationss of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum's area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, cooperativity is necessary for the matching process.",

      "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during bronchopulmonary lavage. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in a venoarterial perfusion circuit was used to provide support of gas exchange during bronchopulmonary lavage in a 32-year-old man with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and severe arterial hypoxemia. Prior to the lavage, Pao2 during mechanical ventilation with 100% oxygen and positive end-expiratory pressure was only 125 mm Hg. Extracorporeal perfusion at a flow rate of 3 liters/min, with oxygen delivery of 244 ml/min, increased the Pao2 to 227 mmHg and lowered the mean pulmonary artery pressure from 28 to 24 mm Hg. During bronchopulmonary lavage and ECMO, the Pao2 ranged between 46 and 96 mm Hg. After the procedure, pulmonary performance decidely improved. By reducing the chances of fatal hypoxemia, ECMO allowed treatment to be instituted for this potentially reversible disorder and proved helpful as a form of support during the management of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis when severe hypoxemia may have other wise precluded bronchopulmonary lavage."

The frequency of occurrence of mandibular lesions was highest in caribou 7 years of age and older, and there was a higher prevalence in adult males than in adult females. Trauma, dental abscesses, and periodontal disease were the probably cause of most lesions. Pathogenic bacteria were not isolated from mandibular lesions from an 11 year-old female.

      "Etiological determinants of protein calorie undernutrition in a rural child community. Two groups of randomly selected underweight and well-nourished preschool children residing in study villages of Punjab, Ludhiana district were examined with respect to their socioeconomic background, birth weights, dietary intakes, quality of received mother care, blood biochemistry, parasite load, psychomotor development and past illness prevalence. It was found that underweight children showed significantly less favourable indices in all of the above categories except stool parasitology suggesting an extremely intricate and complex interaction of a host of ecological variables in the causation of undernutrition. Using the discriminate analysis on readily available social variables, it was found that caste affiliation and, less so parental income were the two most significant variables distinguishing between the two groups. A model for the interaction patterns of ecological variables in their effect of protein calorie malnutrition for the given area is suggested."

In addition to clonidine, tramazoline, also a preferential presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor agonist, produced a reduction in electricallly evoked salivation. Methoxamine, noradrenaline and naphazoline, which are less potent presynaptic alpha-receptor agonists, caused increases in salivation. Phentolamine only partially antagonized the decrease in salivation produced by clonidine whereas it was virtually abolished by yohimbine. Clonidine increased salivation evoked by intra-arterial injections of carbachol. These findings suggest that clonidine reduces peripheral parasympathetically evoked submaxillary salivation by activation of presynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors which inhibit cholinergic transmission.",

      "Different antihypertensive effect of beta-blocking drugs in low and normal-high renin hypertension. The treatment response to beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs was compared in two groups of patients with primary (essential) hypertension and different renin levels. Each group consisted of 25 patients and was equally distributed regarding age, severity and stage of hypertension. In the first group (group 1), the mean upright plasma renin activity was 0.8 ng ml-1h-1 (range 0.3 to 1.5) and the patients were considered to have low renin hypertension. In the other group (group 2) the patients had a mean plasma renin activity of 2.1 ng ml-1h-1 (range 1.1 to 5.1) and were considered to have normal to high renin hypertension. In both groups the patients were initially treated with beta-blocking drugs; in group 1 with a beta-blocker corresponding to an average dose of 311 mg propranolol a day for at least eight weeks and in group 2 with propranolol 320 mg a day in a fixed dose for eight weeks. The hypotensive response differed significantly between the two groups (p less than 0.001). In group 1 the pretreatment blood pressure was 197/117 mm Hg supine and 198/120 mm Hg standing. During treatment blood pressure decreased only 5/3 mm Hg supine and 9/5 mm Hg standing. The pretreatment blood pressure in group 2 was 187/114 mm Hg supine and 186/117 mm Hg standing. Beta-blocking therapy reduced blood pressure 36/23 and 34/18 mm Hg, respectively (both p less than 0.001). Pulse rates fell significantly in the two groups, both in the lying and standing positions. In 17 patients with low renin hypertension (group 1), a volume-depleting drug was added (spironolactone, 14 patients; thiazides, 3 patients) and this achieved a marked fall in blood pressure levels of 38/16 mm Hg supine and 37/19 mm Hg standing (both p less than 0.001). These results suggest the following: (1) Most patients with normal to high plasma renin activity respond well to moderate doses of propranolol. (2) Propranolol given in the same doses is almost without antihypertensive effect in patients with low renin hypertension. (3) A volume factor may be operating in patients with low renin hypertension since a hypotensive effect is demonstrated after the addition of volume-depleting drugs. (4) Determination of plasma renin activity with adequate methods can predict the treatment response to hypotensive agents."

Twenty-four hr later, the awake rats were restrained and the carotid clasps tightened to produce 4-vessel occlusion. The carotid clasps were removed after 10, 20 or 30 min of 4-vessel occlusion and the animals killed by perfusion fixation 72 hr later. Rats which convulsed during the ischemic or post-ischemic period were excluded from further study. All rats subjected to 20 or 30 min of 4-vessel occlusion demonstrated ischemic neuronal damage. The H1 and paramedian hippocampus, striatum and layers 3, 5 and 6 of the posterior neocortex were the regions most frequently damaged. The advantages of this model are the ease of preparation of large numbers of animals, a high rate of predictable ischemic neuronal damage, a low incidence of seizures and the absence of anesthesia.",

      "Enamel microhardness and fluoride uptake underneath fermenting and non-fermenting artificial plaque. Washed cells of Streptococcus sanguis were used to form artificial plaque on the surface of bovine enamel and incubated underneath buffer solutions, initial pH 6, for 36 h at 37 degrees C. The decrease in the microhardness of the enamel surface under fermenting \"plaque\" could be prevented with fluoride. Enamel under a fermenting \"plaque\" took up significantly more (P less than 0.0u) fluoride than enamel under a non-fermenting \"plaque\" (initial F- in buffer: 10 parts/10(6)). The artificial plaque did not accumulate fluoride. Within fermenting \"plaques/, the pH decreased significantly more without flouride (P less than 0.01) than with fluoride. Fluoride combined with sucrose more than negated the softening of the enamel caused by sucrose fermentation, i.e. it increased the hardness above the original values. The diffusion of fluoride through the fermenting artificial plaque was more rapid than through a non-fermenting plaque. These findings suggest that caries-conducive circumstances may promote fluoride uptake by enamel compared with non-caries-conducive circumstances."

On the whole, the studies on GCF have demonstrated that the flow of this fluid is sufficiently indicative of the inflammatory state that it can be used under a variety of clinical conditions to monitor and control gingival inflammation. Since gingivitis is extremely common, and since some cases of gingivitis presumably do not progress to periodontitis, the question could be posed whether or not a concerted effort to control inflammation (i.e. trying to achieve a GCF flow as near to zero as possible) would be clinically significant. Until there is evidence to the contrary, the answer must be \"yes\", since few cases are known where periodontitis occurs without being preceded by gingivitis. In other words, the control of all gingivitis, if feasible, should prevent most cases of periodontitis. Although control of all gingivitis would mean the treatment of many cases that would not progress to periodontal breakdown, such efforts would be worth-while if most periodontal destruction were prevented. Even the early destructive lesion exhibiting little or no inflammation may soon be identified, mainly because the minute volume of fluid collected from the gingival crevice can now be measured accurately. Accordingly, the concentration of various constituents in the GCF can be determined, which should lead to the development of tests to differentiate between pockets undergoing active destruction with minimal inflammation from the majority of active lesions that are intimately involved with frank inflammation. Thus, a clinician would measure sub-clinical gingival inflammation by measuring GCF flow, then differentiate destructive from quiescent lesions by analyzing the GCF sample for some constituent(s), chemical or microbial (Listgarten et al. 1975) indicative of the periodontal destructive process. Monitoring the flow of GCF might be of value in other clinical situations. For example, one could monitor the response of gingival tissues to various restorative and prosthetic procedures (Strauss et al. 1975) to ensure that these procedures do not aggravate the periodontal tissues and induce gingivitis or periodontitis. The education of the patient should be easier since patients can read their own numbers on the GCF meter at each examination and self-evaluate their personal periodontal condition and the effectiveness of their home care. Even the education of the dental student should be easier since he or she would have the means of self-evaluating the effectiveness of treatment, and not be as dependent upon the subjective assessment of his efforts by an instructor. Finally, monitoring GCF for various components could provide the dentist with a valuable means of easily screening patients for systemic disease. Obviously, this area of investigation is in its infancy, but does promise an exciting future for the oral diagnostician.",
      "Blastogenic response of human lymphocytes to oral bacterial antigens: comparison of individuals with periodontal disease to normal and edentulous subjects. Cell-mediated immunity in humans to antigens derived from oral plaque bacteria was investigated by using the lymphocyte blastogenesis assay. Subjects with varying severities of periodontal disease including normal, gingivitis, periodontitis, and edentulous were compared. Mononuclear leukocytes were separated from peripheral blood and cultured with antigens prepared by sonication of Actinomyces viscosus (AV), Actinomyces naeslundii (AN), Veillonella alcalescens (VA), Leptotrichia buccalis (LB), Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM), and homologous dental plaque (DP). The lymphocyte response of subjects with gingivitis or periodontitis was significantly greater than that of normal subjects to antigens of AV, AN, and DP, but did not differ from the response of edentulous subjects. Periodontitis subjects were significantly more reactive than edentulous and normal subjects in response to VA, LB, and BM. These findings suggest that the tested gram-negative bacteria and the host response they evoke are associated with advanced periodontal destruction.",

Immediately after delivery the pH and the level of lactic acid in the maternal artery, umbilical vein and umbilical artery were determined. The level of lactic acid after the work test was negatively correlated with the physical performance of the mother. The level of lactic acid in the mother after the work test and the levels of lactic acid in the umbilical vessels were positively correlated. The mean pH value in physically fit women after delivery was almost significantly higher than in the women of below average performance. The pH level in the umbilical artery was also almost significantly higher in the mothers with above average performance. The physically fit women appear to work more during delivery than the less fit mothers, as the level of lactic acid after the delivery was as high as or higher than in mothers with a physical performance below average. The physical fitness of six mothers, who delivered an asphyxiated baby, was almost significantly lower than the performance of the mothers. Five mothers with an exceptionally high pH after delivery had a significantly higher performance than the other mothers."

      "[Thiamine deficiency in chronic alcoholics. Value of pre- and postoperative treatment]. Thiamine deficiency in the chronic alcoholic would appear to have a triple origin: inadequate intake, absorption and utilisation. Its consequences are well known: peripheral neuropathy, WERNICKE and KORSAKOFF type encephalopathies and cardiac problems (with asystole at the extreme). The active principle of thiamine, TPP or cocarboxylase, is involved as a coenzyme of pyruvate decarboxylase and of alphaketoglutarate decarboxylase in the ocidative decarboxylation reactions of the Krebs cycle. TPP is involved as a coenzyme of transketolase in the transketolisation reactions of the pentose pathway. The stimation of transketolase demonstrates a deficiency in thiamine. Fourteen patients suffering from surgical ENT malignancies were involved in the present study. Seven patients received vitamin B therapy before and after the operation. The results showed a significant decrease in thiamine deficiency. Seven were used as controls and did not receive vitamin B therapy. Transketolase estimations showed and increase in the deficiency. Thiamine deficiency exists in the chronic alcoholic and may be corrected by the administration of B vitamins.",

Of these, three, five, four and one species respectively have apparently been introduced by man. The non-introduced fauna is clearly Indo-Australian in origin, but some species have an exclusively Pacific island distribution and others (two bats, seven birds, and four lizards) are endemic. On the six islands visited 95 out of the possible 98 vertebrate species occur. Santo, the largest and most northerly island, supports the richest fauna. The comparative impoverishment of more southerly islands is not directly attributable to the progressive increase in isolation and distance from presumptive source area, nor to decrease in island area or maximum height.",

Cardiorespiratory reflex responses to laryngeal chemoreceptor stimulation were studied in 62 piglets of both sexes varying in age from 1 to 79 days.

Introduction of either water or milk produced apnea, bradycardia, and hypertension. Swab application of test fluids to the laryngeal epithelium produced similar responses. The reflex could be interrupted by flushing the laryngeal region with saline, by cutting the superior laryngeal nerves (SLN) or by anesthetizing the laryngeal epithelium with lidocaine. Electrical stimulation of SLN elicited identical responses. Respiratory inhibition by the reflex was enhanced following central depression with chloralose and overridden by administration of the respiratory stimulant, aminophylline. The relative potency of the laryngeal reflex was estimated to be equivalent to about 40% of the dose of chloralose which produced permanent respiratory arrest. It is concluded that in circumstances where respiratory drive is reduced the laryngeal inhibitory reflex is capable of caused persistent apnea and asphyxial death in the young piglet.",
      "Cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis in the thyroid gland. General properties and key role in the interrelations between concentrations of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate. Phosphodiesterase activities of horse (and dog) thyroid soluble fraction were compared with either cyclic AMP (adenosine 3':3'-monophosphate) or cyclic GMP (guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate) as substrate. Optimal activity for cyclic AMP hydrolysis was observed at pH 8, and at pH 7.6 for cyclic GMP. Increasing concentrations of ethyleneglycol bis(2-aminoethyl)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid inhibited both phosphodiesterase activities; in the presence of exogenous Ca2+, this effect was shifted to higher concentrations of the chelator. In a dialysed supernatant preparation, Ca2+ had no significant stimulatory effect, but both Mg2+ and Mn2+ increased cyclic nucleotides breakdown. Mn2+ promoted the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP more effectively than that of cyclic GMP. For both substrates, substrate velocity curves exhibited a two-slope pattern in a Hofstee plot. Cyclic GMP stimulated cyclic AMP hydrolysis, both nucleotides being at micromolar concentrations. Conversely, at no concentration had cyclic AMP any stimulatory effect on cyclic  GMP hydrolysis. 1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine and theophylline blocked the activation by cyclic GMP of cyclic GMP of cyclic AMP hydrolysis, whereas Ro 20-1724 (4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone), a non-methylxanthine inhibitor of phosphodiesterases, did not alter this effect. In dog thyroid slices, carbamoylcholine, which promotes an accumulation of cyclic GMP, inhibits the thyrotropin-induced increase in cyclic AMP. This inhibitory effect of carbamoylcholine was blocked by theophylline and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, but not by Ro 20-1724. It is suggested that the cholinergic inhibitory effect on cyclic AMP accumulation is mediated by cyclic GMP, through a direct activation of phosphodiesterase activity.",

These differ in elution profile on Sephadex G-200, solubility in ammonium sulfate, metal ion requirements and kinetic properties. Phosphodiesterase I has Km values of 11 muM and 1.8 muM for cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, respectively, has 5-fold greater maximal activity with cyclic AMP than with cyclic GMP, and is activated by Mg2+ and Co2+, and inhibited by EDTA. phosphodiesterase II has Km values of 625 muM and 125 muM for cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP, respectively, has similar maximal activity with both substrates, and is not activated by divalent metal ions or inhibited by EDTA. Cyclic nucleotides and methylxanthines competitively inhibit both enzymes. Phosphodiesterase is found in both soluble and particulate fractions of homogenates. Total activity is highest during the larval stage of the insect, drops markedly following pupation, and rises again during pharate adult development."

      "Dependence of phrenic motoneurone output on the oscillatory component of arterial blood gas composition. 1. The hypothesis that respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition influence ventilation has been examined. 2. Phrenic motoneurone output recorded in the C5 root of the left phrenic nerve and the respiratory oscillations of arterial pH in the right common carotid artery were measured in vagotomized anaesthetized dogs which had been paralysed and artificially ventilated. 3. The effect of a change in tidal volume for one or two breaths on phrenic motoneurone output was measured with the inspiratory pump set at a constant frequency similar to, and in phase with, the animal's own respiratory frequency. A reduction of tidal volume to zero or an increase by 30% led to a corresponding change of mean carotid artery pH level. The changes of carotid artery pH resulted in a change of phrenic motoneurone output, predominantly of expiratory time (Te) but to a lesser extent of inspiratory time (T1) and also peak amplitude of 'integrated' phrenic motoneurone output (Phr). Denervation of the carotid bifurcation blocked this response. 4. The onset of movement of the inspiratory pump was triggered by the onset of phrenic motoneurone output. When a time delay was interposed between them, the phase relationship between respiratory oscillations of arterial pH and phrenic motoneurone output altered. The dominant effect was to alter Te; smaller and less consistent changes of Phr and T1 were observed. 5. When the inspiratory pump was maintained at a constant frequency but independent of and slightly different from the animal's own respiratory frequency (as judged by phrenic motoneurone output), the phase relationship between phrenic motoneurone output and the respiratory oscillations of pH changed breath by breath over a sequence of 100-200 breaths, without change of the mean level of arterial blood gas composition. Te varied by up to 30% about its mean value depending on the phase relationship. Ti and Phr were also dependent on the phase relationship but varied to a lesser extent. The changes were comparable to the results obtained in paragraph 4. 6. It was concluded that phrenic motoneurone output is dependent in part on its relationship to the respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition. 7. Information concerning a transient ventilatory disturbance is stored in the arterial blood in the form of an altered pattern of the respiratory oscillations of blood gas composition; this in turn can change breathing by an effect on the carotid bodies.",

The activities of orotate phosphoribosyl transferase (OPRT) and orotidine monophosphate decarboxylase (ODC) were significantly elevated (P less than 0.001) in erythrocytes (RBC) from five patients with prednisone-responsive congenital hypoplastic anaemia (CHA). (OPRT: patients - 10.1--64.2 nmol/h/10(9) RBC; controls - 2.8 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- SEM, n = 37); ODC: patients = 30--124 nmol/h/10(9) RBC; controls = 10.2 +/- 0.7 (mean SEM, n = 37).) Two patients had a less pronounced, but significant, increase of aspartate transcarbamylase activity and three patients had marginal increases of dihydroorotase activity.

In one patient prior to prednisone therapy, the OPRT and ODT activities were elevated 10-fold and remained elevated 3-fold after 16 months of therapy. An elevated enzyme pattern similar to that of RBC from CHA patients was observed in three parents of three CHA patients, but not in three parents of two other CHA patients.

In contrast, the activities of all the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes were elevated in blood from patients with a young RBC population: sickle cell anaemia, sickle-beta-thalassaemia, hereditary spherocytosis, and DiGuglielmo syndrome and from the newborn.

      "Immunological studies of T-cell receptors. II. Limited polymorphism of idiotypic determinants on T-cell receptors specific for major histocompatibility complex alloantigens. These studies explore the extent of genetic polymorphism in the expression of anti-MHC receptors by T cells in different strains of rats. This question was approached with the use of the model of specifically induced GVH resistance in F1 rats which has been shown to reflect a specific T-cell mediated immune response against parental strain T cell anti-MHC receptors specific for host alloantigens. When A/B F1 rats derived from MHC incompatibile matings are immunized with lymphocytes from one parental strain (A they display a specific resistance to anti-B GVH reactivity caused by T cells from that parental strain, but not anti-AGVH reactions from the other. In addition, they resist anti-B GHV reactivity by T cells from third-party donors (C, D, E,...), a finding taken to indicate that the idiotypes of anti-MHC receptors on T cells, recognized by other T cells, show little or no polymorphism. This conclusion suggests that anti-MHC receptors are shared in the species and may be encoded, at least partially, by germ-line genes.",

Functional anti-HBs bound to erythrocytes was measured by radioimmune assay using 125 I-HBsAg. The attachment of anti-HBs to aldehyde-stabilized cells is favored by low pH and low ionic strength. The extent of antibody binding is both concentration and time dependent. Development of spontaneous agglutination of the coated erythrocytes occurs with the attachment of increasing quantities of anti-HBs. Although antibody was rapidly taken up by aldehyde-stabilized erythrocytes, it was initially readily dissociable, but after longer exposure became firmly bound. Experiments pertaining to the chemical nature of the more stable antibody-erythrocyte complex gave results consistent with covalent bond formation, though rigorous proof was not developed."

      "[Sugar-free, tooth-protecting chewing gum and candy. Results of a 7-year study]. Experiences of 7 years with sugarless chewing gums and lozenges (tab. I and II) regarding their tooth protective properties are reported. Telemetry of interproximal plaque pH allows to assess acid formation from carbohydrates by plaque bacteria under almost natural conditions. Altogether, 5 chewing gums and 8 lozenges containing sorbitol or mixtures of sorbitol and hydrogenated oligosaccharides were investigated. Lowest pH values during and after chewing sugarless gums varied between pH 6.0 and 7.3. When sucking sugarless lozenges the recorded pH values were between 5.8 and 7.0. In contrast to lozenges, the consumption of sugarless chewing gums becomes particularly important due to their greater stimulation of saliva and buffering capacity of oral fluid. All products tested did not acidify interproximal plaque below the critical pH and therefore comply with the regulations of the Swiss Federal Health Authorities with respect to the labeling or marketed sweets with \"safe for teeth\". New non-fermentable sugar-replacing substrates are being developed. Their utilization in foodstuffs and sweets is being discussed.",
      "Arthritis and hepatitis. The evidence relating four clinically distinct rheumatologic syndromes to infection by the hepatitis B virus is reviewed. Acute hepatitis B is not infrequently heralded by a prodromal rash and rheumatoidlike polyarthritis. Chronic active hepatitis B more rarely is associated with transient arthritis or arthralgias. Polyarteritis nodosa may be a manifestation of hepatitis B infection in as many as 40 percent of cases, and recently the syndrome of \"essential\" mixed cryoglobulinemia has also been linked to infection with this virus. The finding of immune complexes of varying composition, sometimes with the viral antigen or its antibody (or both) contained in both the serum and synovial fluid suggests that these four syndromes are clinical manifestations of immune complex disease resulting from hepatitis B infection."

The recent hypothesis that phototherapy is capable of altering the liver cell, enough to allow passive diffusion of free bilirubin from the blood to the bile, and the discovery of substantial differences between the breakdown products of bilirubin obtained in vivo and in vitro, has prompted the AA. to investigate the enzymatic values in newborn infants with jaundice undergoing phototherapy. A study was made of the variations of cytolithic enzymes (GPT-GOT-GLDH-SDH) and secretions enzymes (FA-LAP-gammaGT-CHE) before and after phototherapy among different sized groups of infants with jaundice, between the 36th and 40th week of the gestational age, and with body weight varying from 1940 to 4150 g.

A comparison between hepatectomy and hepatic devascularization in the pig. Difficulties in the treatment of acute hepatic failure due to insufficient knowledge of the pathogenesis and the impredectability of the course has made an experimental model desirable. A number of such models have been proposed, among these hepatectomy and total hepatic devascularization. In the present study hepatectomy and total hepatic devascularization have been compared, as it has been doubted if hepatectomy, not including necrotic liver tissue, is a valid model of human hepatic failure. No significant difference was found in the survival time which was 16 h 2 min +/- 57 min in the anhepatic and 18 h 33 min +/- 1 h 5 min in the devascularized preparation. The blood pressure of the anhepatic preparation decreased gradually, in contrast that of the devascularized preparation remained stable during most of the experimental period with a terminal steep decrease. Except for an increase in serum alanin-aminotransferases and free hemoglobin, seen in the devascularized, but not in the anhepatic preparation, no differences between the two models were seen. It is concluded that the presence of necrotic tissue is of minor importance, but for technical reasons the devascularized preparation is the most suitable model for experimental hepatic failure.",

Biochemical studies on the two transaminases GOT and GPT of swine kidney worm Stephanurus dentatus have been made. GOT has been found much more active than GPT. Enzyme activities are based on the formation of oxaloacetate (GOT) or pyruvate (GPT) from aspartic acid and alanine respectively with oxoglutarate. A linear relationship is observed between the enzyme concentration and activity. GOT shows a maximum activity at pH 8.0 and Michaelis constant 9 X 10(-3) M for male and 2.9 X 10(-3) M for female. GPT has an optimum pH of 7.5 and a Michaelis constant 19 X 10(-3) M for male and 8 X 10(-3) M for female. The optimum temperature for both GOT and GPT was 60 degrees C.",
      "Effect of liver failure on the ventilatory response to hypoxia in man and the goat. 1. The ventilatory responses to transient and steady-state hypoxia were measured in ten patients with hepatic cirrhosis and in ten healthy control subjects. Successive measurements of these responses were also obtained in six goats before and after the experimental production of liver failure. Changes in the effect of steady-state hypoxia on the ventilatory response to hypercapnia were evaluated by successive studies in another goat. 2. In spite of a respiratory alkalosis during liver failure, the response to transient hypoxia was greater in the patients than in the control subjects. This response was increased after the onset of liver failure in all the goats. 3. In healthy humans and goats the responses to transient and steady-state hypoxia were similar in magnitude. During liver failure there was a disparity between the size of these responses, since the ventilatory increment evoked by steady-state hypoxia was unchanged in spite of the increase in response to transient hypoxia. Steady-state hypoxia consistently enhanced the ventilatory response to hypercapnia in a healthy goat, but frequently depressed the response to hypercapnia during liver failure. 4. The findings suggest that liver failure heightens the sensitivity of the peripheral chemoreceptors to the hypoxic stimulus, but may increase the tendency of the medullary centres to become depressed in hypoxia."

The possible cause of uterine rupture with vacuum extraction appear to be a combination of an unengaged fetal head, an incompletely dilated cervix and an undetected mild cephalopelvic disproportion especially in grandmultiparae, dehiscent or weak uterine scars, prolonged traction without progress, manipulations in shoulder dystocia and obstruction and excessive non controlled traction.

The epidermal ultrastructure of 11 allogeneic bone marrow recipients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was compared with that of 4 recipients without chronic GVHD. This electron microscope study revealed three patterns of epidermal injury typical of chronic GVHD. The first type was a nonacantholytic (nondissecting) injury with a prominent cellular infiltrate consisting primarily of lymphocytes accompanied by a few macrophages. The second type was an acantholytic (dissecting) injury with a prominent infiltrate, while the third was a nondissecting injury with a sparse infiltrate. Broad-zone contact was observed between lymphocytes and all epidermal cell types as well as between other lymphocytes and macrophages. Point contact was only observed between lymphocytes and epidermal cells. Lymphocytes appeared to detach desmosomes from adjacent keratinocytes by isolating them with cytoplasmic projections, a phenomenon not previously described. Typical damage to the epidermal cells in the basal and spinous layers consisted of either swelling of the organelles or condensation of the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the keratinocyte, the condensation reaction resulted in the formation of colloid bodies, some of which were phagocytized by macrophages. Besides the cytolytic events, a concurrent stimulatory reaction occurred in the epidermal cells. The number of melanosomes in melanocytes and of Langerhans cell granules and dense bodies in the Langerhans cells all increased. Extensive areas of replication and disruption of the basal lamina were subjacent to areas of necrosis in the basal layer.",
      "Graft-versus-host reaction. Cutaneous manifestations following bone marrow transplantation. The distinctive cutaneous changes that occur in both the acute and chronic forms of the graft-vs-host reaction (GVHR) are described in two living patients in whom the GVHR developed after bone marrow transplantation for aplastic anemia. In the skin, the mild form of the acute GVHR is recognized as a subtle macular erythema, and the severe form appears as erythematous papules and violaceous macules with scale. Skin biopsy specimens in both of the acute forms show vacuolar alterations of the epidermal basal-cell layer with a perivenular infiltrate of lymphocytes. The chronic GVHR evolves from generalized scaling to diffuse areas of aclerotic and atrophic skin with a curious reticulated hyperpigmentation, ulcerations, and alopecia. Histopathologic study shows collagenization of the dermis that can be correlated with the clinical sclerodermoid changes. Owing to its visibility, the skin offers a unique opportunity for the early recognition of the GVHR.",
      "The role of divalent cations in epidermolysis. In experiments designed to elucidate the role of divalent cations in maintaining the integrity of the epidermis, newborn mouse skin was incubated in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) or ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA). In EDTA, epidermolysis occurred and was confirmed by rubbing the specimen to demonstrate that a sheet of epidermis could be split off. After 30 min incubation in 0-01 mol/EDTA the split occurred in the lower granular-upper spinous layer; after 45 min, it was in a spinous-suprabasilar location and at 60 min and later at the dermal-epidermal junction. Ultrastructurally, a clear zone of apparent intracellular oedema occurred along the cell membranes. The split then occurred intracytoplasmally through this clear zone and the adjacent cell membrane was lost. Since incubation in EGTA at pH 7-4 did not result in epidermolysis, we suggest that the removal of magnesium rather than calcium is responsible for epidermolysis. Thirty min after the addition of either calcium or magnesium to EDTA-treated specimens, epidermolysis could no longer be demonstrated."

A case report. Urodynamic studies were carried out in a 14-year-old boy with Prune Belly Syndrome and terminal renal failure prior and after successful renal transplantation. Increased bladder capacity, nonprovocative detrusor instability and a high compliance were the most characteristic findings during the filling phase of the bladder. During the voiding phase an increased detrusor pressure was demonstrated. Outflow resistance and maximum urinary flow rate were within normal range before and after transplantation. In contrast to the findings before renal transplantation, however, micturition was imbalanced after transplantation (residual urine 100 ml). Urodynamics revealed that the bulging of the posterior urethra, observed in the early voiding phase, was due to a congenital insufficiency of the posterior urethral musculature (megalourethra) and not caused by mechanical obstruction leading to urethral dilatation. It is suggested that detrusor-bladder-neck-dyssynergia is the primary cause of the imbalanced micturition and its consequences (bladder distention, reflux, urinary tract infection, hydronephrosis, pyelonephritis) in patients with Prune Belly Syndrome.

      "Cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx/larynx and lung in North Thailand: case-control study and analysis of cigar smoke. The unusually high relative frequency of cancer in the laryngeal region in males (18% of all histologically diagnosed cancers) and a sex ratio of unity for lung cancer in Northern Thailand were further explored in a hospital-based case-control study in Chiang Mai. This compared patients having cancers of the oral cavity (including oropharynx), larynx, hypopharynx and lung, with controls in relation to smoking and chewing habits. Statistical analysis indicated that chewing betel is strongly associated with the occurrence of oral cancer in both sexes, and with cancer of the laryngeal region in males. No factors were strongly linked to lung cancer in men, but, in women, urban residence and miang chewing were associated with lung cancer. Analysis of smoke from the two main types of cigars smoked in the region showed that both had high tar content, but there were marked differences in pH. Smoking cigars with alkaline smoke and high tar had an increased risk for laryngeal cancer in males, whereas other cigars with acid smoke and high tar together with manufactured cigarettes had increased risks for lung cancer.

A morphologic investigation on 100 cervices removed at autopsy from negro Jamaican women at different ages showed that columnar epithelium was frequently located on the portio vaginalis at all ages. The absence of this phenomenon in some fetal cervices supports the hypothesis of embryologic displacement rather than stimulation by maternal estrogens. Squamous metaplasia was common at all ages, even in the fetus; it showed little relationship to chronic inflammation, but the high frequency in post-pubertal cases (80%) could have some relationship to the high incidence of cervical cancer in Jamaica. Chronic inflammation was not observed in the fetal cervix but occurred in most infants in whom it was attributed to congenital \"erosion\". However, the cervices of children revealed a marked discrepancy between the presence of \"erosion\" and the degree and frequency of chronic inflammation (83%). This change is unexplained and requires further study.",
      "Observations of human fetal otoconial membranes. Intact otoconial membranes from 31 human fetuses ranging in gestational age from 14 to 36 weeks were studied. At all stages of development specimens from different individuals showed marked variations in overall shape. During the course of the second and third trimesters, both saccular and utricular otoconial membranes were found to increase three to fourfold in surface area and more than twofold in weight. Near the end of gestation the fetal specimens were about equal in area and weight to otoconial membranes from children up to 13 years of age. However, the crystal layers of the fetal membranes has less prominently developed surface contours than usually observed in children and adults, indicating that maturational changes continue after the time of birth.",
      "Gallium-67 citrate scintiscanning in testicular neoplasia. Gallium-67 citrate has been used to evaluate 19 patients with malignant tumors of the testes. Five patients with abnormal uptake of the radiotracer in the abdomen proved to have other evidence confirming metastatic spread to this site. Eight patients, with normal scan findings, surgery and lymphangiorgraphy, provided no conflicting evidence of disease although one of these patients has subsequently developed increased urinary gonadotrophin concentrations. Surgery caused an abnormal scan and such patients were excluded from the analysis pointing to the need for preoperative evaluation. The technique of 67-gallium scintigraphy appears of value in assessing the intra-abdominal spread of malignant tumors of the testes."

      "The effect of ovarian wedge resection and incision on circulating gonadotropin in patients with polycystic ovarian disease. Wedge resection (WR) was performed in 12 women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), and Incision was done in 4 PCOD patients without any resection of ovarian tissue. Serum LH, FSH, estradiol-17beta (E2), progesterone, and urinary 17 ketosteroid (17KS) were measured serially before and after surgery. Neither WR nor Incision had any effect on FSH levels. Serum LH levels which had been hypergonadotropic preoperatively, became markedly lower 7--14 days after surgery in 12 wedge-resected and 2 incised patients. Within 7 days after WR there was a significant fall of E2 and a decrease of 17KS. In addition to those hormonal changes observed after WR, BBT charts turned out to be diphasic after the oral administration of dydrogesterone (Duphaston) in 12 out of 17 PCOD patients. The present data suggest that the reduction of the serum LH, induced by an interaction between the ovarian steroidogenesis and the suprapituitary mechanisms, might be involved in the occurrence of ovulation after WR in PCOD patients.",
      "[Caesarean section: low transverse (pfannenstiel) or midline incision? (author's transl)]. In 67 elective Caesarean sections and 70 emergency sections the effect of the duration of anaesthesia upon the condition of the newborn was examined. The induction-delivery time (IDT), the operation time (OT), and the difference between these, delta t, were correlated with the 1-, 5- and 10-minute Apgar scores and the pH's of the venous and arterial umbilical cord blood. A highly significant negative association was found for the pH in the umbilical vein and delta t in the series of primary sections. Analysis of the emergency sections showed a negative association between the operation time and the 5 minute Apgar score, and a positive association between the delta t and 1 minute Apgar score. Despite these findings we have observed that the induction-delivery time which we are able to achieve in our hospital has no negative effect upon the biochemical condition (pH) of the newborn. A comparison of 619 sections performed by low midline incision with 328 section by Pfannenstiel incision showed no difference with regard to postoperative complications such as disturbance in wound healing or haematoma formation. In conclusion, with respect to the IDT and postoperative complications we have found no contraindication to the use of the low transverse Pfannenstiel incision for Caesarean section."

The morphological basis of impulse conduction in a jellyfish epithelium was investigated. Lanthanum impregnation of endodermal canal and endodermal lamella verified the existence of true gap junctions in Polyorchis. In both transverse and en face sections of gap junctions, electron-lucent globules, with a width of 7--8 nm and a spacing of about 11 nm, are evident. Gap-junctions are concentrated at the peripheral canal margin and septate junctions are localized around the canal lumen. Epithelial cells of the endodermal canals are capable of conducting a non-decrementing action potential. It is suggested that endodermal spike propagation, which can mediate 'crumpling' behaviour, is dependent upon low-resistence ionic pathways provided by gap-junctions and upon sealing of the intercellular space from saline extracellular fluids by septate junctions.",

A four-unit symmetrical premolar extraction case demands meticulous levelling, overjet reduction, space closure, rotating, paralleling and torqueing to justify the gambit of having extracted the teeth at the commencement of treatment.

Since 1972, all patients for whom a surgical decision was considered were examined at the Anaesthetic out-patients and the advantages appear obvious. The type of premedication, the choice of the anesthetic technique were classical in the vast majority of cases and, in particular, intubation was carried out as a routine."

The tests were based upon the assumption that the viewpoints of the periodontal teachers are the correct ones and can be used to identify the affective objectives. The results of the present study indicate that the students' attitudes changed and became similar to the viewpoints of the faculty as an effect of the discussion seminars. This observation speaks in favor of the use of such seminars for effective teaching as a supplement to didactic teaching and clinical instruction.",
      "Phosphofructokinase. III. Correlation of the regulatory kinetic and molecular properties of the rabbit muscle enzyme. It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation."

Transmission in the cardiac vagal reflex pathway can be inhibited by stimulation of the hypothalamic defense region or somatic afferent nerves. A pharmacological analysis of inhibitory modulation of reflex vagal bradycardia was undertaken in the present study. Picrotoxin (0.5--1.5 mg/kg i.v.) or bicuculline (0.5--1.5 mg/kg i.v.) produced a dose-related blockade of inhibition of reflex vagal bradycardia elicited by stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus or branches of the brachial plexus in spinal (C1 or C8 transected) cats. In contrast, strychnine and pentylenetetrazol failed to change the heart rate responses produced by stimulation of the hypothalamus or brachial plexus afferents. Picrotoxin and bicuculline also blocked inhibition of reflex vagal bradycardia produced by stimulation of the inferior olive in decerebrate spinal cats. This observation supports the contention that these agents act in the brain stem to block inhibitory modulation of reflex vagal bradycardia. In addition, picrotoxin and bicuculline lowered basal heart rate in spinal cats but not in decerebrate spinal cats. This observation suggests that tonic suprabulbar inhibition of reflex vagal bradycardia also is sensitive to blockade by picrotoxin and bicuculline.",
      "Dependence of phrenic motoneurone output on the oscillatory component of arterial blood gas composition. 1. The hypothesis that respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition influence ventilation has been examined. 2. Phrenic motoneurone output recorded in the C5 root of the left phrenic nerve and the respiratory oscillations of arterial pH in the right common carotid artery were measured in vagotomized anaesthetized dogs which had been paralysed and artificially ventilated. 3. The effect of a change in tidal volume for one or two breaths on phrenic motoneurone output was measured with the inspiratory pump set at a constant frequency similar to, and in phase with, the animal's own respiratory frequency. A reduction of tidal volume to zero or an increase by 30% led to a corresponding change of mean carotid artery pH level. The changes of carotid artery pH resulted in a change of phrenic motoneurone output, predominantly of expiratory time (Te) but to a lesser extent of inspiratory time (T1) and also peak amplitude of 'integrated' phrenic motoneurone output (Phr). Denervation of the carotid bifurcation blocked this response. 4. The onset of movement of the inspiratory pump was triggered by the onset of phrenic motoneurone output. When a time delay was interposed between them, the phase relationship between respiratory oscillations of arterial pH and phrenic motoneurone output altered. The dominant effect was to alter Te; smaller and less consistent changes of Phr and T1 were observed. 5. When the inspiratory pump was maintained at a constant frequency but independent of and slightly different from the animal's own respiratory frequency (as judged by phrenic motoneurone output), the phase relationship between phrenic motoneurone output and the respiratory oscillations of pH changed breath by breath over a sequence of 100-200 breaths, without change of the mean level of arterial blood gas composition. Te varied by up to 30% about its mean value depending on the phase relationship. Ti and Phr were also dependent on the phase relationship but varied to a lesser extent. The changes were comparable to the results obtained in paragraph 4. 6. It was concluded that phrenic motoneurone output is dependent in part on its relationship to the respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition. 7. Information concerning a transient ventilatory disturbance is stored in the arterial blood in the form of an altered pattern of the respiratory oscillations of blood gas composition; this in turn can change breathing by an effect on the carotid bodies.",
      "The anatomy of neurosecretory neurones in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis (L.). The anatomy of three neurosecretory cell types in the central nervous system (c.n.s.) of the gastropod mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis (L.)- the Dark Green Cells, Yellow Cells and Yellow-green Cells-has been studied by using bright and dark field illumination of material stained for neurosecretion by the Alcian Blue-Alcian Yellow technique. The neuronal geometry of single and groups of neurosecretory cells of the various types has been reconstructed from serial sections, and the likely destination of most of their processes has been determined. Dark Green Cells are monopolar, occur exclusively within the central nervous system (c.n.s.), have few or no branches terminating in neuropile, and send axons to the surface of the pleuro-parietal and pleuro-cerebral connectives. The majority of Dark Green Cell axons however (80-85%), project down nerves which innervate ventral and anterior parts of the head-foot, the neck and the mantle. Dark Green Cell axons can be found in small nerves throughout these areas, and may terminate in a find plexus of axons on the surfaces of the nerves. Since previous experimental work has shown that the Dark Green Cells are involved in osmotic or ionic regulation, these results suggest that the target organ of the Dark Green Cells may be the skin. Yellow Cells occur both within and outside the c.n.s. They are usually monopolar, but can be bipolar. They have several axons which normally arise separately from a single pole of the cell body, or close to it. One or more processes leave the cell proximal to the point where separate axons arise, and may run unbranched for some distance through neuropile before terminating in fine brances and blobs of various sizes. These branches may release hormone inside the c.n.s. Yellow-green Cells are mono-, bi- or multi-polar, and like the Yellow Cells are found both within and outside the c.n.s. Some Yellow-green Cells, though not all, have projections which terminate in neuropile in fine branches and blobs. Yellow-green Cell bodies which occur in nerves can project back along the nerve into the c.n.s. The axons of Yellow Cells and Yellow-green Cells project to release sites in various ways. Some project into the connective tissue shealth of the c.n.s., which serves as a neurohaemal organ, either directly through the surface of a ganglion, or from the pleuro-cerebral or pleuro-parietal connectives. Other axons leave the c.n.s. via nerves leaving the left and right parietal and visceral ganglia; projections into the intestinal, anal, and internal right parietal nerves being most numerous. Axons which may be from either, or both Yellow Cells and Yellow-green Cells, can be found along the entire unbranched lengths of these nerves, and in subsequent branches which innervate organs lying in the anterior turn of the shell. All of these orgnas are closely associated with the lung cavity..."

      "Disturbance of the machinery for the gene expression by acidic pH in the repressible acid phosphatase system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When the pH of growth medium containing a limited amount of inorganic phosphate is kept below 3.0, cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae produce repressible alkaline phosphatase but no repressible acid phosphatase. The same cells produce acid phosphatase immediately on shifting the medium pH to 4.0 or above. Like intact cells, spheroplasts prepared from cells grown at pH 3.0 or 4.5 in medium with a limited amount of inorganic phosphate in suspension begin production of acid phosphatase immediately after pH shift from below 3.0 to 4.0 whereas sheroplasts from cells grown in inorganic phosphate-rich medium showed a prolonged lag period (3 h). The enzyme formation on the pH shift was sensitive to cycloheximide. No significant differences could be detected in cellular growth or in incorporation of 3H-L-lysine or 14C-adenine between cells cultivated at pH 3.0 and 4.5. These results along with the fact that the expression of structural genes of repressible acid and alkaline phosphatases is controlled by a common genetic regulatory system, at least in part, indicate that the genetic regulatory system operates to express the structural genes even at low pH, though the expression of repressible acid phosphatase is interrupted. Coupled experiments of temperature and pH shifts with the temperature-sensitive mutants of the regulatory genes suggest that the acidic pH affects the function of the cytoplasmic products of those genes in the expression of the structural gene. Based on these observations, a revised model involving the simultaneous functioning of the regulatory factors was suggested for the genetic regulation of repressible acid phosphatase synthesis.",
      "Reversion in expression of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in 6-thioguanine resistant neuroblastoma: evidence for reduced enzyme levels associated with unaltered catalytic activity. Five clones of mouse neuroblastoma cells able to grow in hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine containing medium were isolated from a hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT; EC 2.4.2.8; IMP: pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase) deficient cell line. These hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine resistant revertant clone had 45-55% of wild-type cell HGPRT activity. Kinetic studies indicated that the HGPRT in revertant clones had a reduced maximal velocity as compared to wild type cells based on cell protein. Apparent Km values of HGPRT for hypoxanthine and 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate were similar in wild-type and revertant cells. Heat inactivation studies demonstrated a similar heat lability for HGPRT in revertant and wild-type cells. An antibody fraction prepared from serum of rabbits immunized with HGPRT partially purified from mouse liver was used to measure the amount of cross-reacting material in normal and revertant clones. The revertant clones had one-half the amounth of cross-reacting material present in wild-type cells, based on a given amount of cell protein. These data indicate that the revertant cells may contain fewer HGPRT molecules with unaltered catalytic activity."

The pH-values were measured after incubating the mixed plaque flora for 1 and 7 days in the presence of various sugars. Both the arithmetic and geometric means of the total CFU values on Rogosa S.L. agar decreased in the S-group at the 6-month phase but returned to the starting level after one year, whereas in the X-group they decreased or remained on the starting level. At the 6-month phase the difference between the groups was significant (U-test, p = 0.0013) and almost significant (U-test, p = 0.0569) at the end of the study. No significant differences or changes could be seen between or within the groups on Sabouraud agar. The geometric mean values of S. sanguis and S. mutans as well as the total CFU values on phenol red agar decreased considerably in both the S- and X-groups, but no significant differences could be detected in any of the streptococcal counts between the groups. The pH of the carbohydrate-containing culture media infected with mixed dental plaque significantly decreased, with the exception of the xylitol containing ones in which the pH values were not lowered even after 7 days' incubation. A significant decrease in plaque formation in relation of chewing per se was demonstrable. The difference in the plaque index values equalling or exceeding 2 was significant between the S- and X-groups. No bacterial adaptation to utilize xylitol occurred during the trial.",
      "Gingival crevicular fluid: a new diagnostic aid in managing the periodontal patient. On the whole, the studies on GCF have demonstrated that the flow of this fluid is sufficiently indicative of the inflammatory state that it can be used under a variety of clinical conditions to monitor and control gingival inflammation. Since gingivitis is extremely common, and since some cases of gingivitis presumably do not progress to periodontitis, the question could be posed whether or not a concerted effort to control inflammation (i.e. trying to achieve a GCF flow as near to zero as possible) would be clinically significant. Until there is evidence to the contrary, the answer must be \"yes\", since few cases are known where periodontitis occurs without being preceded by gingivitis. In other words, the control of all gingivitis, if feasible, should prevent most cases of periodontitis. Although control of all gingivitis would mean the treatment of many cases that would not progress to periodontal breakdown, such efforts would be worth-while if most periodontal destruction were prevented. Even the early destructive lesion exhibiting little or no inflammation may soon be identified, mainly because the minute volume of fluid collected from the gingival crevice can now be measured accurately. Accordingly, the concentration of various constituents in the GCF can be determined, which should lead to the development of tests to differentiate between pockets undergoing active destruction with minimal inflammation from the majority of active lesions that are intimately involved with frank inflammation. Thus, a clinician would measure sub-clinical gingival inflammation by measuring GCF flow, then differentiate destructive from quiescent lesions by analyzing the GCF sample for some constituent(s), chemical or microbial (Listgarten et al. 1975) indicative of the periodontal destructive process. Monitoring the flow of GCF might be of value in other clinical situations. For example, one could monitor the response of gingival tissues to various restorative and prosthetic procedures (Strauss et al. 1975) to ensure that these procedures do not aggravate the periodontal tissues and induce gingivitis or periodontitis. The education of the patient should be easier since patients can read their own numbers on the GCF meter at each examination and self-evaluate their personal periodontal condition and the effectiveness of their home care. Even the education of the dental student should be easier since he or she would have the means of self-evaluating the effectiveness of treatment, and not be as dependent upon the subjective assessment of his efforts by an instructor. Finally, monitoring GCF for various components could provide the dentist with a valuable means of easily screening patients for systemic disease. Obviously, this area of investigation is in its infancy, but does promise an exciting future for the oral diagnostician.",
      "Comparison of dextranases for their possible use in eliminating dental plaque. Dextranases produced by P lilacinum NRRL 896 and NRRL 895 and by P funiculosum NRRL 1768 were studied for their possible incorporation into a dental plaque elimination system. The following properties of the enzymes were compared: effect of the pH level on the activity and the stability of the enzymes on the acid side of the pH range; molecular weight; affinity to Sephadex G-25 which served as a model for insoluble dextran in plaques; and the extent of hydrolytic action on dextrans containing alpha-1,3, alpha-1,4 and alpha-1,6 bonds in various proportions. The enzyme of P funiculosum NRRL 1768 certainly has its limitations as a plaque-degrading enzyme, for example, diminished activity at a high pH level and lack of activity on alpha-1,3 bonds. However, from our studies, and from a survey of the relevant literature with respect to the aforementioned properties in other dextranases, the enzyme of P funiculosum NRRL 1768 emerges as a suitable choice for incorporation as dextranase, possibly together with other enzymes, into an enzymatic dental plaque elimination system."

An electron-microscopy investigation and morphometric analysis were carried out in 30 specimens of bioptic material of the fundal part of the stomach in patients with duodenal ulcer with the hyperacid syndrome. At all levels of the Major gastric glands parietal cells with morphological signs of intensive secretory activity prevailed, which was one of the causes (apart from the increase in the mass of parietal cells) of considerable intensification of secretion of hydrochloric acid. It was suggested that a considerably increased (as compared with the norm) area of the surface of the crysts of mitochondria with simultaneous reduction of the coefficient of their fragmentation was the morphological substrate of a high functional activity of parietal cells of the gastric mucosa in the hyperacid syndrome.",
      "[Morphometric and electron microscopic study of the small intestine following total orthotopical auto- and allotransplantation]. Total orthotopic autotransplantation of the small intestine was performed in 22 dogs, allotransplantation--in 13 dogs. Changes in the wall of the graft resulted from the effect of both nonspecific (ischaemia, blockage of lymph outflow, denervation) and specific factors connected with the reaction of tissue incompatibility. Changes caused by the nonspecific factors are demonstrated as lymphostasis, edema of the wall in the graft, atrophy of the villi with epithelial flattening, hyperplasy of the intestinal gland, macrophagal and plasmocytic reaction in the mucous lamina propria, drop in villous-cryptic coefficient and reduction of the absorbing surface of the villi. At autotransplantation, structural-functional changes in the intestine undergo three stages: the stage of acute morphological changes and pronounced functional disturbances (up to 1,5 months); the stage of relative structural stabilization and gradual functional restoration (up to 6 months); the stage of atrophic-hyperplastic changes in the wall and decrease in functional activity of the intestinal graft (followed-up for 15 months). At allotransplantation, depending on the degree of cellular reaction and vascular changes, as well as on the localization of the process in the wall of the graft, a \"graft versus host\" reaction and a \"recipient versus graft\" reaction is demonstrated. Peculiar rosettes of plasmocytes have been described as a possible index of the reaction \"graft versus host\".",

Guanylate cyclase is found in virtually all cells, but its physiologic role and the effect of hormones on its activity have not been clarified. Hepatic soluble guanylate cyclase activity (37,000 g supernatant) in rats with diabetes-mellitus-like syndrome induced by streptozotocin, 65 mg./kg. i.v., was 140 +/- 8 pmoles accumulated/mg. protein/10 min. (n = 13 rats) as against 279 +/- 16 pmoles accumulated/mg. protein/10 min. (n = 12 rats) in normal rats. The average blood sugar for the 12 normal rats was 100 +/- 4 mg./100 ml. and 546 +/- 32 mg./100 ml. for 13 diabetic rats. The decreased soluble hepatic guanylate cyclase activity in diabetic rats was completely restored to normal with 10 U. regular insulin, i.p. The maximum increase in guanylate cyclase activity was observed as early as five minutes and as late as two hours after insulin administration. Insulin restoration of guanylate cyclase was dose-related over a range of 1 U. to 10 U., i.p. Hepatic cyclic GMP levels in vivo paralleled in-vitro guanylate cyclase activity, being 29 +/- 0.4 pmoles/gm. wet weight in normals, 17 +/- 0.4 pmoles/gm. wet weight in streptozotocin-diabetic rats, and 38 +/- 0.4 pmoles/gm. wet weight two hours after the injection of 10 U. regular insulin. We conclude that rat hepatic guanylate cyclase is decreased in streptozotocin-induced diabetes and that insulin modulates this enzyme. The administration of exogenous insulin in normal animals did not further augment hepatic guanylate cyclase activity.",
      "Carcass components at first estrus of rats on high-fat and low-fat diets: body water, protein, and fat. Carcass analysis data show that weanling rats fed high-fat (HF) and low-fat (LF) diets until the day of first estrus had similar body compositions at estrus, although the HF rats had estrus significantly earlier and at a lighter body weight (P less than 0.01) than the LF-diet rats. Total water as percent of wet weight, protein as percent of wet weight, and the water/protein ratios of the HF- and LF-diet rats did not differ significantly, whereas the absolute amounts of body water and protein of the two diet groups differed significantly (P less than 0.01), in accord with means (+/- SEM) of total body water as percent of wet weight were 66.2 +/- 0.3% for the HF rats and 66.4 +/- 0.3% for the LF-diet rats, whereas the mean absolute total body water for the two diet groups was 69.7 +/- 2.2 g and 81.1 +/- 2.4 g, respectively (P less than 0.01). Carcass fat of the HF rats, 15.6 +/- 1.0 g, was identical with that of the LF-diet rats, 15.6 +/- 0.9 g. The HF rats were therefore relatively fatter, 14.6 +/- 0.6 wet weight %, than the LF-diet rats, 12.6 +/- 0.4 wet weight % (0.05 greater than P greater than 0.01). The percentage of water in the fat-free wet weight of the HF rats, 77.5 +/- 0.3%, was significantly (P less than 0.01) greater than that of the LF-diet rats, 76.1 +/- 0.3%. These data and the high percentages of total water of body weight show that at first estrus the HF- and LF-diet rats had not as yet attained an adult body composition, similar to the human female at menarche. Within each diet group, the percentages of total water/body weight, protein/wet weight and fat/wet weight, or fat/dry weight, did not change significantly with increasing age of estrus, whereas each absolute carcass component--body water, protein, and fat--increased significantly with increasing age of estrus. The carcass data support G.C. Kennedy's hypothesis that a metabolic signal, related to fat stores, is a signal for puberty in the rat and are in accord with the hypothesis that a critical body composition of fatness is necessary for estrus in the rat, as in the human female. The greater relative fatness of the HF-diet rats may be associated with higher levels of estrogen in the HF rats than in the LF-diet rats.",
      "Some mechanisms of reduction of carotenoid levels in chickens infected with Eimeria acervulina or E. tenella. The levels of plasma carotenoids were markedly reduced in broiler cockerels infected with Eimeria acervulina or E. tenella. The mechanisms of this depigmentation differed between the two species, being primarily associated with interference of absorption of xanthophyll (carotenoids) from the intestinal lumen with E. acervulina infection and with leakage through the damaged wall of the cecum with E. tenella infection. Chicks reared on an essentially carotenoid-free diet and inoculated with E. acervulina showed no detectable levels of carotenoids in the blood 48 hours after being changed to a diet containing 30 mg of xanthophyll/kg. Conversely, uninoculated chicks and chicks inoculated with E. tenella showed significant and similar increases in plasma levels of carotenoids. Chicks reared on a diet containing xanthophyll and inoculated with E. tenella showed a more rapid decrease in plasma carotenoids than did uninoculated controls when changed to a xanthophyll-free diet. In chicks fed high xanthophyll diets containing chromic oxide, no indication of malabsorption was seen in chicks infected with E. tenella compared with uninoculated controls, whereas chicks inoculated with E. acervulina showed significantly less xanthophyll absorption. Conversely, a marked increase in the xanthophyll : Cr2O3 ratio was observed in the cecal contents of chicks inoculated with E. tenella compared with uninuoculated controls or those inoculated with E. acervulina. Studies of uninoculated chicks pair-fed with chicks inoculated with E. acervulina or E. tenella indicated that the decrease in plasma carotenoids and increases in intestinal pH are not associated with the reduced intake of feed associated with infection. The studies involving uninoculated birds with reciprocal chagnes between high and low xanthophyll diets indicated that plasma carotenoids are a more rapid and sensitive means of measuring changes in pigmentation levels than are visual skin scores carotenoid levels from the skin."

The discontinuous gradient technique for recovery of malarial sporozoites from mosquitoes (Beaudoin et al., 1977) has been modified to speed up recovery and prevent sensitization of mice by components of the gradient which contaminate the sporozoites used as antigen. Mouse serum was substituted for BSA in the gradient because the latter produced hypersensitivity. Best results were obtained with gradients consisting of Medium 199, Renografin and mouse serum. Heavy and light solution of gradient components are layered in a centrifuge tube. Centrifugation of comminuted, infected mosquitoes applied to the top of the discontinuous gradient concentrates sporozoites at the interface. Sporozoites recovered from the gradient were infective, immunogenic, and relatively free of mosquito tissue.

The haemodynamic effects of massive doses of hydrocortisone (80-320 mg.kg-1), methylprednisolone (4-32 mg.kg-1), betamethasone (1.6-12.8 mg.kg-1) and aldosterone (0.1-0.8 mg.kg-1) and the interaction with phenoxybenzamine and propranolol have been studied during controlled haemorrhagic shock in the anaesthetized dog. Hydrocortisone was the only steroid which showed any significant vasodilating ability when given alone. The alpha-receptor blocking agent phenoxybenzamine distinctly decreased the total peripheral resistance. The effect of the phenoxybenzamine was increased in combination with hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone, especially if the steroid was given as the first drug. The vasodilation found was efficiently abolished by the beta-receptor blocking agent propranolol. The ability of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone to potentiate phenoxybenzamine was not shared by betamethasone or aldosterone. Thus, the haemodynamic effect of the steroid does not seem to be correlated to either a glucocorticoid nor a mineralocorticoid effect. It is suggested that the steroid effect studied is related to the ability of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone to block the extra neuronal amine uptake which decreases the rate of elimination of the sympathetic transmitter from the vicinity of the adrenergic receptor of the vascular smooth muscle.",
      "Skeletal muscle PO2: indicator of peripheral tissue perfusion in haemorrhagic shock.

However, this treatment results in marked haemodilution and correction of extracellular fluid loss remains inadequate.",
      "The adrenergic mechanism of the haemodynamic effects of massive doses of hydrocortisone in controlled haemorrhagic shock in the dog. Haemorrhagic shock was induced in anaesthetized dogs by bleeding them into a blood reservoir system. By adjusting the blood level of the reservoir at a certain distance over the heart level the mean arterial blood pressure was kept at 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg). As has been found earlier, massive doses of hydrocortisone (80-560 mg.kg-1 body weight) caused a dose-dependent decrease in the total peripheral resistance. The degree of vasodilation distinctly increased during concomitant alpha-receptor blockade induced by phenoxybenzamine. The beta-receptor blocking drug propranolol efficiently inhibited the vasodilation caused by hydrocortisone and phenoxybenzamine. The findings fit with the hypothesis that massive doses of hydrocortisone induce an increased stimulation of the adrenergic beta2-receptors of the vascular smooth muscles."

CaCl2 suppresses the plasma renin activity (PRA) response to Na+ deprivation in the rat. The purpose of the present study is:1) to determine if the effect of Ca2+ on PRA is modified by the anion delivered with Ca2+, and 2) to evaluate the effect of Ca2+ loading on aldosterone production. PRA and in vitro aldosterone production by adrenal quarters were measured after a 7-day balance study. On a low Na+ diet, PRA of animals drinking 1% CaCl2 (13.1 ng/ml per h +/- 1.3 SE), but not of animals drinking 1% calcium gluconate, was suppressed (P less than 0.05) compared to that of water-drinking controls (20.9 ng/ml per h +/- 2.1 SE). Aldosterone production of calcium gluconate and CaCl2-loaded animals was greater than that of controls (P less than 0.01). K+ balance of CaCl2 and calcium gluconate-drinking animals was more positive than that of controls (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, inhibition of PRA by CaCl2 but not by calcium gluconate indicates that the effect of Ca2+ on PRA is modified by the accompanying anion. Both CaCl2 and calcium gluconate stimulate aldosterone production, independent of changes in PRA, possibly due to an effect of Ca2+ on K+ balance.",
      "Effectiveness of high-dose spironolactone therapy in patients with chronic liver disease and relatively refractory ascites. Ten patients with ascites due to chronic liver disease were treated with spironolactone as the sole diuretic in doses of 300 to 600 mg daily. Prior to spironolactone treatment ascites was relatively refractory as indicated by baseline 24-hr urine sodium values of less than 5 mEq and natriuresis of less than 30 mEq following 200 mg hydrochlorothiazide. With spironolactone, mean daily weight loss was 540 g and natriuresis 74 mEq; diuresis was considered satisfactory in nine of ten patients. Untoward effects were limited to a single episode of hepatic encephalopathy, a small fall in serum magnesium in several patients, and three instances of hyperkalemia (5.5, 5.6, and 7.5 mEq/liter). In spite of the tendency to hyperkalemia, urinary potassium excretion increased in seven of the ten patients. There was no rise in serum urea nitrogen or creatinine. Hydrogen ion excretion decreased initially leading to mild hyperchloremic acidosis. Serum urate did not increase.",
      "Species differences in the metabolism and disposition of spironolactone. The absorption, excretion and metabolism of [22-14C]spironolactone was compared in Charles River rats, beagle dogs and rhesus monkeys. The drug was administered at the fixed dose of 5 mg/kg po and iv. From the po/iv ratios of the areas under the plasma radioactivity-time curves, the gastrointestinal absorption of the drug was estimated to be 82% in the rat, 62% in the dog, and 103% in the monkey. The absolute bioavailability of a pharmacologically active metabolite, canrenone, was 57% in the dog and 48% in the monkey. Spironolactone was extensively metabolized in all three species and differences existed in the composition of the metabolites in their plasma, urine, and feces. The amount of radioactivity that was excreted in the urine and feces of all three species was similar after either po or iv administration of the drug. The cumulative average excretion of radioactivity in the urine as percentage of the po dose in 6 days was 4.69% in the rat (N = 5), 18.5% in the dog (N = 3), and 46.0% in the monkey (N = 3). In the feces, the corresponding excretion values were 74.2, 69.3 and 40.1%, respectively. Canrenone excretion in the urine constituted 0.65% of the po dose in the rat, 0.82% in the dog, and 5.86% in the monkey, whereas the excretion of total fluorogenic metabolites constituted 1.1, 1.9, and 12.1% respectively. Comparison of animal data with those published for humans indicated that the disposition and metabolism of spironolactone in the rhesus monkey, rather than those in the rat or the dog, was closest to that in man."

      "phiX174 DNA-dependent DNA synthesis in vitro: requirement for P1 ban protein in dnaB mutant extracts of Escherichia coli. Ammonium sulfate fractionation of crude extracts of E. coli yields a soluble enzyme fraction (about 25-fold purification) that catalyzes the conversion of phiX174 single-stranded DNA to duplex DNA. The reaction is rifampicin-resistant, requires single-stranded DNA, Mg++, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and ATP, and is stimulated by KCl. Such soluble enzyme fractions were prepared from E. coli strains carrying the prophage mutant P1bac, in which the viral dnaB analog (ban) protein is expressed constitutively, or P1bacban, in which the expression of ban protein is prevented. DNA-synthesizing activity of ban protein containing fractions from wild-type or dnaB(P1bac) lysogens was more temperature-resistant than that from E. coli containing only wild-type dnaB protein, whereas that from dnaB(P1bacban) lysogens of dnaB cells was extremely thermolabile. It is suggested that the temperature-resistant DNA synthesis with fractions from P1bac lysogens is mediated by the P1 ban protein.",
      "Duplex formation of a nonionic oligo(deoxythymidylate) analogue (heptadeoxythymidylyl-(3'-5')-deoxythymidine heptaethyl ester (d-(Tp(Et))7T)) with poly(deoxyadenylate). Evaluation of the electrostatic interaction. The heptaethyl ester of heptadeoxythymidylyl-(3'-5')-deoxythymidine (d-[Tp(Et)]7T or d-T8-Et) has been prepared by chemical methods. The material, consisting of a mixture of diastereoisomers, forms a 1:1 complex with (dA)n in neutral aqueous buffer; this interaction is virtually independent of ionic strength. The octamer triester does not bind to (dA)n-(dT)n, and it interacts with (rA)n only at low temperatures. By cochromatography with (dA)n on Sephadex G-50, d-T8-Et fractions with different binding affinities for the polyadenylates were obtained. This heterogeneity in binding affinity is ascribed to the diastereoisomerism of d-T8-Et. Enthalpies of dupoex formation were determined by the concentration variation method. At 0.1 M sodium ion concentration, the enthalpy of binding of the various d-T8-Et fractions to (dA)n is essentially invariant (-8.1 kcal/mol of base pairs at 0 degrees C to -8.6 kcal at 25 degrees C) and 1.6 kcal/mol of base pairs more negative than the enthalpy of binding of the phosphodiester analogue, d-(Tp)7T, to (dA)n (-6.8 kcal/mol of base pairs at 11 degrees C). This difference is the electrostatic contribution to the enthalpy of duplex formation, arising from the interstrand electrostatic repulsion and the intrastrand repulsion in d-(Tp)7T. The entropy of binding to (dA)n is more negative for the octamer triesters than for the diester analogue, and is different for the various d-T8-Et fractions. This is interpreted in terms of varying degrees of restriction of rotational freedom for the ethyl substituents upon double helix formation."

Both EDTA and NTA form strong complexes with gallium, which have a 1:1 stoichiometry. In alkaline solution the tetrahedral Ga(OD)4- competes strongly with EDTA in complex formation. In the lactate complex, there are probably three lactates per gallium present. The phosphate complexes of gallium are difficult to characterize on the basis of this investigation.

      "Mechanism of chloride corrosion of dental amalgam. Polarization of conventional dental amalgam in Ringer's solution produces a dissolution of the gamma 2 phase at--250 mV (SCE) and formation of Sn-Cl and Sn-O-Cl. This study was undertaken to determine the electrochemical nature of these reactions. Potentiostatic polarization scans were run at 4, 37 and 50 degrees C in several dilutions of aerated Ringer's solution. Manipulation of reactant concentrations and electrolyte temperature produced shifts in the potentiostatic profiles. At 50 degrees C, a gamma 2 dissolution peak shift to -300 mV was observed, and at 4 degrees C the peak shifted to -200 mV. Dilution of Ringer's solution with respect to [Cl-] over three orders of magnitude produced a linear shift in the noble direction of 500 mV. Cathodic polarization appears to be limited by the oxygen half cell reaction. Changes of [Cl] affect the shape of the peak, round out its approach to the current maximum. Shifts in peak potential due to temperature and concentration changes agreed with calculations based on critical pitting potential for gamma2 dissolution due to a chloride reaction. Polarization profiles in pooled saliva agreed with calculated potentials based on known saliva [Cl-].",
      "[Inhibitory effect platinum and palladium complexes as indicator of conformational changes in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes]. Inhibition of Ca2+-dependent ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes (SRM) by platinum and palladium complexes is considerable enhanced during the incubation of these compunds with SRM preparations in the presence of small (10(-5) M) concentrations of ATP or ADP. AMP and nucleotides with non-adenine bases do not have inhibitory effect. To increase the sensitivity of Ca2+-dependent ATPase to platinum and palladium complexes under the action of ATP (but not ADP), the presence of free Ca2+-ions in the medium is required. In the absence of ATP Ca2+-ions do not affect the inhibiting effect of the complexes. The increase in pH of the medium up to 8.5 and the increase of temperature up to 45degree C sharply decrease the ATP ability to enchance the sensitivity of Ca2+-dependent  ATPase to platinum and palladium compunds. It is assumed that the ATP ability to enhance  Ca2+-dependent ATPase inhibition by platinum and palladium complexes is due to ATP-dependent structural changes in SRM, which increase the availability of certain groups of the enzyme to those compounds."

      "[Technic of pleural drainage (emergency pleural drainage)]. Pleural effusion is still often poorly drained: - incorrect introduction of the drain into the thorax, - ill-chosen position of the drain. Simple drainage, a minima, is considered here, that which requires no broad surgical incision and which, in cases of effusion with compression of the lung, is often a life saving procedure which any doctor should be able to carry out, especially if he deals with emergencies. The surest technique consists of placing a No. 30 drain, using a pleurotomy trocart, type Monod or Coquelet, under local anaesthesia. Introduction of the drain using a forceps after an incision with the scalpel blade is only justified if one has no trocart available. So-called disposable drains, mounted on a pointed bevelled needle prepared in advance, are practical but dangerous. Capillary drainages are methods of second choice. They are often excluded within short delays. The efficacy of the drainage depends on its position.",

      "[Surgery for carcinoma of the esophagus. Methods and techniques]. Given the poor prognosis in carcinoma of the oesophagus, and with the aid of advances in anaesthesia and postoperative care, surgery has progressively evolved towards wider excision and a reduction in the number of operative stages. Partial oesophagectomy, with gastrolysis and gastro-oesophageal anastomosis, via a left thoracotomy, is favoured by large number of authors. However, it involves a certain number of disadvantages: by definition a limited excision, unsuitable for carcinomas in the cervical region and a marked risk of postoperative gastro-oesophageal reflux. Total oesophagectomy offers a hope of better results from an oncological standpoint, the more so since excision may be extended superiorly (laryngectomy) or inferiorly (total gastrectomy with lymph node excision). Continuity is re-established using a colonic transplant. The operation may be performed in two stages, though a single stage procedure with two teams would appear to be preferable, overall mortality and morbidity being reduced. Finally, colonic oesophagoplasty may be used alone, as a simply palliative measure, without associated tumour excision. By short-circuiting the oesophageal stenosis, it permits continued alimentation per os and the patient's period of survival is more comfortable.",

The effects of lipolysis on the structure of chylomicrons were studied with the scanning electron microscope using rat chylomicrons incubated with purified bovine milk lipoprotein lipase for 20 minutes at pH 8.1. Since the amount of albumin added to the medium was limited, some of the free fatty acids and partial glycerides formed by lipolysis accumulated in the chylomicrons. Lipolyzed chylomicrons fixed with OSO4 at pH 7.4 appeared in scanning electron micrographs as spheres with multiply idented irregular surfaces, while those fixed at pH 5.5, AS WELL AS CONTROL CHYLOMICRONS FIXED AT BOTH PHs, appeared as spheres with smooth surfaces. Sections of OSO4-fixed specimens, viewed with the transmission electron microscope, showed that the core of lipolyzed chylomicrons fixed at pH 7.4 contained numerous circular electron-lucent areas at the periphery, thus accounting for the indented surfaces observed above, while the core surfaces of the other specimens were circular and smooth. These findings confirm an earlier report that aqueous spaces form in chylomicrons during lipolysis when albumin in the medium is limited, and that the aqueous spaces disappear when specimens are prepared at pH 5.5 for microscopy. Thin sections of specimens that had been prepared for scanning electron microscopy showed that the gold-palladium coating was desposited directly on the indented surface of the lipid core of lipolyzed chylomicrons fixed at pH 7.4. It is concluded that vacuum dehydration during specimen preparation ruptures the outer wall of the aqueous spaces in lipolyzed chylomicrons and thereby exposes the interior of the spaces to gold-palladium coating and viewing with the scanning electron microscope.",

Our results indicate that apo-B and apo-C are synthesized by membrane-bound ribosomes. Both apoproteins seem to be adsorbed simultaneously to the lipid core of VLDL in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum channels, at the junction zone between rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Some additional protein presumably binds nascent VLDL in the Golgi apparatus as judged by the strong positive reaction of lipoprotein particles with peroxidase-labeled antibodies. Finally our data show that significant amounts of apo-B and apo-C are bound to the sinusoidal plasma membrane in fed rat livers which probably represent remnants of lipoprotein of intestinal origin since membrane-bound apolipoproteins virtually disappeared 24 h after lymphatic duct cannulation. It is suggested that nascent VLDL (apo-C poor) could be enriched in apo-C from lipoprotein remnants at the space of Disse."

Report of a 4-7 year follow-up study. Twenty-five patients with the diagnosis of carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) of the cervix were treated with colposcopy guided epithelial conization. During the follow-up study of 4-7 years' duration, there was no recurrence of CIS in 20 of the 25 patients. Between 6 and 12 months after conization, 3 patients showed recurrence of CIS. Two of these patients were treated with further epithelial conization with no evidence of further recurrence 4 years after the second treatment. The third  patient refused to accept further epithelial conization and modified radical hysterectomy was done without any evidence of residual tumour in the hysterectomy specimen. One patient showed stromal invasion in both colposcopically guided biopsy and bone biopsy. Modified radical hysterectomy specimen showed remnants of stromal invasion. One patient with Class IV smear failed to show any atypical transformation zone and cervicitis was proven on colposcopy guided biopsy following treatment with Flagyl. For two of the 25 patients, cytology was Class II and therefore failed to diagnose the pre-malignant condition; but colposcopy showed a grade 3 atypical transformation zone and the presence of CIS was confirmed histologically. Simultaneous use of cytology, colposcopy and colposcopically guided biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CIS in all cases. The authors recommend colposcopically guided epithelial conization in younger patients, provided the malignant lesion is strictly intra-epithelial, and limited to the ectocervix. Routine follow-up with the aid of cyto-colposcopy remains the key factor in this schedule of therapy.",
      "Therapeutic implications of gentamicin accumulation in severly diseased kidneys. We evaluated the influence of severe disease in human kidneys (12 patients) on gentamicin sulfate accumulation characteristics in such tissue and compared the results with intrarenal tissue concentration data derived from the study of healthy dogs (54 kidneys) during variation in hydration and urinary pH. Our results indicate that, in the management of pyelonephritis complicating preexisting renal disease, if the minimal inhibitory gentamicin concentration for an infecting organism is greater than the usual therapeutic an nontoxic serum levels of the compound, then it may be appropriate to use alternate antibiotics that demonstrate lesser reduction in tissue drug accumulation in diseased kidneys.",

      "Intracellular crystal-bearing vesicles in the epidermis of scleractinian corals, Astrangia danae (Agassiz) and Porites porites (Pallas). Orthorhombic aragonitic crystals, embedded with a granular lipo-protein matrix and surrounded by a trilaminar membrane, are localized in the apical cytoplasm of epidermal cells of Scleractinian corals. Adult specimens of Astrangia danae (Agassiz) and settled planulae of Porites porites (Pallas) contain crystals averaging 0.7 mu by 0.1 mu by 0.3 mu within Golgi-derived vesicles. Short-term labelling with 45Ca reveals distribution of radioactivity amont a basic tissue fraction (92%) an acid tissue fraction (5%) and a skeletal fraction (3%). Identification of the primordial crystal population within membrane-bound visicles provides overwhelming evidence for the intracellular mode of calcification in Scleractinia. Moreover, it permits development of a novel concept of cellular regulation over these dynamic events. The membrane-bound vesicel is a miniature crystal fabrication station and a vehicle responsible for transportation of seed crystals and an organic matrix material to sites of discharge from the cell. The vesicle membrane becomes a probable locus of active transport and enzymatic activity as well as a physical barrier to be penetrated for release of vesicle contents into the extracellular milieu. Contact between the vesicle membrane and the plasmalemma would result in exocytosis and the onset of skeletogenesis. Principles governing crystal growth would prevail from then on. The released crystal becomes a nucleation catalyst and the organic matrix, a supply of ionic calcium for self-limiting crystallization. Crystals are produced by the organism spontaneously and continuously from shortly after larval attachment throughout the life of the polyp. Therefore, these membrane-bound vesicles signal the dynamic process by which initiation, differentiation, growth and limitation of the coral skeleton is regulated.",

With the aim of developing anticancer compounds which overcome some of the clinical limitations of the polar dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, methotrexate, the physicochemical properties, kinetics, and metabolism of a series of lipid-soluble 2,4-diamino-5-phenylpyrimidine folate antagonists have been studied. Metoprine and etoprine, potent inhibitors of mammalian dihydrofolate reductase, were compared with pyrimethamine, a widely used antimalarial drug. The development of assay procedures in our laboratory and the synthesis of radiolabeled compounds have enabled a comparison of the kinetic characteristics and tissue distribution of these compounds in several species. The relative lipophilicities as indicated by the octanol/water partition coefficient are: etoprine (log P = 3.19) greater than metoprine (log P = 2.82) greater than pyrimethamine (log P = 2.69). Etoprine has the greatest affinity for plasma proteins, but all three compounds are bound to human plasma protein by 87% or more at therapeutic concentrations. Pharmacokinetic studies in the mouse, rat, dog, and man indicate that metoprine has the longest plasma half-life in all four species.

      "Amodiaquin accumulation by mouse erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium berghei. [14C]amodiaquin accumulation by washed erythrocyte preparations was characterized to permit comparisons with chloroquine accumulation. Erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium berghei CS (chloroquine-susceptible) accumulate amodiaquin by a saturable process that has an apparent dissociation constant for amodiaquin of 7.6 X 10(-8) M and is competitively inhibited by chloroquine, quinine and quinacrine, as is the process of chloroquine accumulation. Within experimental error, the K1 of 8 X 10(-7) M estimated for chloroquine is the same regardless of whether the drug being accumulated is [14C]amodiaquin or [14C]chloroquine. Likewise, the K1 for amodiaquin is the same regardless of which drug is being accumulated. In addition, glucose stimulates and hydrogen ion, cold or interruption of glycolysis inhibits amodiaquin as well as chloroquine accumulation. These findings are evidence that a single process serves to accumulate both drugs. In the absence of substrate, erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CR (chloroquine-resistant) accumulate twice as much amodiaquin as chloroquine, and they accumulate more amodiaquin than do erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CS. These differences occur because P. berghei CR infects polychromatophilic erythrocytes possessing a high-affinity, substrate-independent process of accumulation to which amodiaquin has greater access than chloroquine. In the presence of glucose, amodiaquin accumulation by erythrocytes infected with P. berghei CR, when plotted as a function of amodiaquin concentration in the medium, describes a sigmoid curve.",

Pedigree analysis of rabbits classified as slow or rapid sulfadiazine acetylators confirmed previous studies that the rate of sulfadiazine elimination (acetylation) is genetically controlled, with rapid elimination dominant over slow elimination of the drug. Pharmacokinetic studies in rabbits of specified sulfadiazine acetylator genotypes with isoniazid and p-aminobenzoic acid show that the rate of isoniazid elimination is under the same genetic control as is sulfadiazine, whereas the rate of p-aminobenzoic acid elimination is not. A new drug acetylation polymorphism, which controls the rate of enzymatic acetylation of p-aminobenzoic acid in peripheral blood cells and which is related to the sulfadiazine acetylation polymorphism, is described."

The titration behavior of individual tyrosine residues of myoglobins has been studied by observing the pH dependence of the chemical shifts of Czeta and Cgamma of these residues in natural abundance of 13C Fourier transform NMR spectra (at 15.18 MHz, in 20-mm sample tubes, at 37 degrees) of cyanoferrimyoglobins from sperm whale, horse, and red kangaroo. A comparison of the pH dependence of the spectra of the three proteins yielded specific assignments for the resonance of Tyr-151 (sperm whale) and Tyr-103 (sperm whale and horse). Selective proton decoupling yielded specific assignments for Czeta of Tyr-146 of the cyanoferrimyoglobins from horse and kangaroo, but not the corresponding assignment for sperm whale. The pH dependence of the chemical shifts indicated that only Tyr-151 and Tyr-103 are titratable tyrosine residues. Even at pH 12, Tyr-146 did not begin to titrate. The titration behavior of C zeta and Cgamma of Tyr-151 of sperm whale cyanoferrimyoglobin yielded a single pK value of 10.6. The pH dependence of the chemical shift of each of the resonances of Tyr-103 of the cyanoferrimyoglobins from horse and sperm whale could not be fitted with the use of a single pK value, but was consistent with two pK values (about 9.8 and 11.6). Furthermore, the resonances of Czeta and Cgamma of Tyr-103 broadened at high pH. The titration behavior of the tyrosines of sperm whale carbon monoxide myoglobin and horse ferrimyoglobin was also examined. A comparison of all the experimental results indicated that Tyr-151 is exposed to solvent, Tyr-146 is not exposed, and Tyr-103 exhibits intermediate behavior. These results for myoglobins in solution are consistent with expectations based on the crystal structure.",

Proton NMR titration curves of the histidine Cepsilon-H resonances of the deoxy and oxy forms of human, horse, and sperm whale myoglobins (Mb) were determined and compared with the results for the met and azide forms. One extra titrating resonance (H-8) was observed for each deoxy-Mb compared with the corresponding met-Mb, and a further extra resonance (H-9) was observed for the oxy-Mb form. These resonances correspond to the two additional resonances previously described for azide-Mb [Hayes, M., Hagenmaier, H., &amp; Cohen, J. S. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 7461--7472]. This new evidence prompts us to reassign these resonances to the near-heme histidine residues.",

The effects of changes in the groups attached to the periphery of the porphyrin ring of the heme of various hemoglobin and myoglobins on the environment experienced by the ligand, carbon monoxide, have been studied by observation of the chemical shift of the bound 13CO. The results indicate that the major interaction between bound ligands and substituents around the porphyrin is that transmitted electronically from substituent to ligand. The nature of the protein environment around the ligand and the interaction between the proximal histidine (F8) and the ligand (through the iron atom) impose differences between subunits of hemoglobin and between myoglobins and hemoglobins which are largely, but not entirely, independent of these substituent effects. To assess the influence of protein structure on the chemical shifts of bound ligand, the shifts of 13CO bound to myoglobin and hemoglobins from a wide range of species have also been measured."

      "Variation in human semen viscoelastic properties with respect to time post ejaculation and frequency of ejaculation. The present study concerns the rheological characterization of the coagulation-liquefaction process of human semen. Results obtained using a multiple point capillary viscometer reveal marked variations in the elasticity and viscosity of an individual's semen with time immediately following ejaculation and frequency of ejaculation. Similarity among all cases examined for each material property is revealed by relating times post ejaculation to semen liquefaction time, thereby coupling liquefaction time with specific material property values. Further, the final state of liquefied semen is found to be characterized by Newtonian behavior (mean absolute viscosity = 3.37 centipoise). The semen's liquefaction time and ejaculate volume are determined to be functions of the frequency of ejaculation. Steady state ejaculate volume is found to decrease linearly with increasing ejaculation frequency, thereby providing a measure of glandular secretory rate. When collectively considered, these findings provide possible means for monitoring an individual's glandular behavior over an extended period of time and comparing such behavior to established standards.",

Of the total content of IgA in sinus secretion, 30% (purulent secretion) and 43% (serous secretion) were calculated to be locally produced, on average. For IgG these figures were 15% (purulent secretion) and 18% (serous secretion), whereas IgM could not be estimated by the method used. It was also concluded that the maxillary sinus is a suitable organ for investigation of local immunity in regard to bacterial infections.",
      "Gerontological aspects of hyperostosis frontalis interna. Authors discuss hyperostosis frontalis interna observed in a large number of aged persons, on the basis of age and sex distribution as well as its clinical and roentgenomorphological analysis. In various forms of the ossification of the frontal bone no significant difference was found between the localisation of hyperostosis and the clinical symptoms. On other hand, there is a direct correlation between the extension and severity of hyperostosis and the frequency of occurence of the associated symptoms (obesity, hypertension). They found the aetiological classification more adequate than the morphological categorization of Moore. Their cases are discussed 1. as partial phenomenon of the Morgagni's syndrome; 2. as independent alteration, showing no other symptoms; 3. as transitionary forms inserted between the two groups mentioned above. They discuss also the question of senile, compensatory hyperostosis frontalis interna. On the basis of the study of a large autopsy material they support the opinion that there is a direct connection of this form with old age.",
      "Purulent and non-purulent maxillary sinus secretions with respect to pO2, pCO2 and pH. Antral secretions from patients with maxillary sinusitis were aspirated for determination of pO2, pCO2 and pH. In 14 non-purulent secretions the mean pO2 was 12.7 kPa (96 mmHg) and the mean pCO2 5.2 kPa (39 mmHg). The mean pH was slightly alkaline. In 18 purulent secretions, usually with a heavy growth of pneumococci or H. influenzae, the pO2 was zero or close to zero and the mean pCO2 greater than or equal to 10.1 kPa (greater than or equal to 76 mmHg). The mean pH was slightly acid and significantly lower than in the nonpurulent secretions. The gas composition and the pH in purulent secretions do not only influence the metabolic activity and multiplication of bacteria, but may also interfere with the local protective functions of the sinus mucosa and with the bactericidal function of granulocytes."

      "Problems of implementation and consequences of the 1975 provisional law to liberalize abortion in France. The passage of the 1975 law to liberalize abortion in France was inevitable because of the inadequacy of the 1920 law. The new law was passed quickly at the end of 1974 and its rapid implementation on January 17, 1975, caught public health officials by surprise. Two benefits have resulted from the law's implementation: (a) abortion has become a medical act, reducing the incidence of illegal termination of pregnancy and its complications; and (b) it has limited the need to travel to more liberal countries for an abortion. Chief among the law's disadvantages are the nonapplication of certain of its sections, the absence of means to curb noncomplying physicians and a certain laxity in its application due to inadequate public knowledge of the risks involved in repeated abortions.",
      "Severe ischemia of the hand following radial artery catheterization. Percutaneous radial artery catheterization for blood gas monitoring and continuous arterial pressure recording has become a common place procedure in the management of critically ill patients. Five patients with severe ischemia after cannulation have been encountered in the past 20 months, four of whom lost segments of one or more digits. Review of the events preceding and during radial artery cannulation allowed elucidation of the following principles: radial artery catheterization should be preceded always by a negative Allen test; the catheter should be removed after 12 to 18 hours, especially if the patient is critically ill, is hypercoagulable, or has impaired tissue perfusion; the superficial temporal artery is safer to use and permits long-term cannulation (5 to 7 days) without ill effect; and agressive approach to assessing flow and arterial reconstruction is essential if severe ischemic symptoms occur during or after radial artery catheterization. Ancillary measures, including cervicodorsal sympathetic block, intravenous low molecular weight dextran and heparin, and intra-arterial reserpine and fibrinolysin, may improve palmar circulation but should not be substituted for both noninvasive and angiographic study of arterial flow, followed by surgical restoration of flow, when indicated."

III. Correlation of the regulatory kinetic and molecular properties of the rabbit muscle enzyme. It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation.",
      "Effect of changing the composition of the bathing solutions upon the isometric tension-pCa relationship in bundles of crustacean myofibrils. 1. The relative isometric tension-pCa relationship has been determined for isolated bundles of barnacle myofibrils under a variety of ionic conditions using [Ca(2+)]-buffered solutions which also contained an ATP regenerating system (creatine phosphate and creatine kinase).2. The results are in better agreement with the ;consecutive' scheme of reaction rather than with the ;independent' alternative (Ashley &amp; Moisescu, 1972) for the co-operative action of two Ca(2+) ions in the process of tension activation in crustacean skeletal muscle.3. Variations in the pH of the activating solutions did have a marked effect on the relative tension-Ca curve, although no effect was observed on the absolute maximum value for isometric tension. A shift in pH by 0.5 u. in the range 6.6-7.6 shifted the Ca(2+)-activation curve by 0.5 log u. towards lower free Ca(2+) concentrations.4. Changes in the free Mg(2+) concentration of the activating solutions in the millimolar range produced a pronounced shift of the relative tension-pCa curve along the pCa axis. Increasing [Mg(2+)] from 1 to 5 mM shifted the curve by about 0.7 log u. to higher free Ca(2+) concentrations, without significantly modifying its steepness.5. Changes in the MgATP concentration of the activating solutions in the range of 1-13 mM had no significant effect on the relative tension-pCa relationship.6. Varying the K(+) concentration in the activating solutions was also observed to have a marked effect upon the tension-pCa relationship in barnacle. An increase in the K(+) concentration from 90 to 170 mM shifted the curve by some 0.6 log u. towards higher free Ca(2+) concentrations.7. Cooling the standard activating solutions from room temperature to +4 degrees C made no apparent difference to the relative tension-pCa relationship, but decreased significantly the absolute tension responses.8. The results presented show that tonicity by itself has a marked effect upon the absolute steady-state tension levels in isolated bundles of myofibrils.9. Maximum isometric tension in this preparation was not simply related to ionic strength, or to the monovalent cation concentration, but it depended, as well, upon the anionic composition of the activating solution. In addition, a change in ionic strength of 25 mM over the range of 245-270 mM did not appear to modify the relative tension-pCa relationship.10. The effect of the physiologically occurring cations H(+), K(+), Mg(2+) upon the relative isometric tension-pCa relationship can be accounted for on the basis of a model of competitive inhibition between these cations and Ca(2+) for the functional unit for tension. This inhibitory effect appears to involve at least one H(+), one Mg(2+) and two K(+) per each Ca(2+) ion participating in the activation process of the functional unit for tension.",
      "Immobilization of actin and myosin. Using glutaric dialdehyde, the muscle proteins myosin, actin, actomyosin and heavy meromyosin subfragment-1 (S-1) have been immobilized on capron fibers. The ATPase activity of myosin and its capability to interact with actin have been preserved whereas the ATPase activity of its subfragment decreased significnatly. Immobilization on capron fibers changes the pH dependence of the ATPase activity of myosin and of S-1 shifting the maximum towards the acid zone (pH 5.5) and increases the thermal stability of the enzyme. Calcium ions produce a stimulatory effect on ATPase; Mg2+ions yield no effect on myosin and S-1 but enhance the activity in the case of immobilized actomyosin though to a lesser degree than the ions of Ca2+. Immobilized actin retains its ability to form actomyosin complex."

In addition to the perinatal infant mortality rate, the number of children with malnutrition, the frequency of premature babies, the presence of a low Apgar score (less than or equal to 7) and pathological pH-values in the umbilical artery (pH less than or equal to 7,10) were cheked. Moreover the frequency of early neonatal morbidity (presence of one of the following criteria: 1 minute Apgar score less than or equal to 7, pH of the umbilical artery less than or equal to 7, 10, a transitoric or severe RDS and neurological complications during the newborn period) was investigated in both groups. In the group of the old primiparae a significantly higher perinatal infant mortality rate was found compared to the control group (3,8% versus 0,6%, p less than 0.05). The rate of small for date babies was remarcably higher than in the control group (14,6% versus 6,4%, p less than 0.05). There was no difference in the prematurity rate in both groups. The children of old primiparae had more frequently a low Apgar score (less than or equal to 7) than infants of the randomised control group (18,5% versus 11,5%), but the difference is statistically not significant. Furthermore no difference in the number of pathological pH values in the umbilical arteries (pH less than or equal to 7, 10) were found in the both groups.

      "Pharmacists' knowledge and attitudes regarding monitoring the behaviors of children with learning disabilities. The attitudes and knowledge of pharmacists in Nebraska regarding children's learning disabilities were surveyed by questionnaire. One hundred thirty-three pharmacists responded.

The results indicate that pharmacists are being asked about learning disabilities. Overall, 53% of the pharmacists responding had been asked about learning disabilities by parents, physicians, teachers or others. No significant interactions were found between the type of practice and age, and no significant main effect for type of practice was found in the ANOVA results for knowledge scores or attitude scores. Even though there were no differences owing to age in pharmacists' knowledge of learning disabilities, age was found to have a significant effect on attitudes toward increased pharmacist involvement in monitoring behaviors of learning-disabled children; the younger groups had a more positive attitude.

A correlation between increased arylsulfatase activities and decreased sulfated proteoglycan content in human osteoarthritic articular cartilage suggested a possible interrelationship between these parameters. Since we had previously shown that ascorbate caused a decrease in levels of arylsulfatase A and B activities in normal chondrocyte cultures, the validity of the above relationship was examined by measuring the effect of vitamin C on the biosynthesis and distribution of 35S-labeled proteoglycans and arylsulfatase A and B activities in cell extracts of chondrocytes derived from normal and osteoarthritic tissue. Arylsulfatase A and B activities were found to be reduced in the presence of ascorbic acid in all normal and osteoarthritic cell lines examined when measured 3, 6, 10, and 13 days after the introduction of the vitamin in the culture medium. Acid phosphatase activity, on the other hand, was found to be elevated in the presence of ascorbate. The inhibitory effect by ascorbic acid on arylsulfatase activities could be reversed by withdrawing the vitamin from the nutrient medium. Addition of EDTA to the cell extracts before assay also reversed the inhibiton. Sulfated proteoglycan biosynthesis as reflected in 35S-sulfate uptake per milligram of DNA was significantly increased in the presence of ascorbic acid. The distribution of the newly synthesized molecules between the cell layer and medium fractions was altered. In the presence of ascorbate, more deposition into the cell layer of newly synthesized macromolecules occurred. These data suggest an inverse relationship between arylsulfatase activities and the stability of the newly synthesized sulfated proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix.",
      "Detection and incidence of B and C vitamin deficiency in alcohol-related illness. The activity of the red blood cell enzymes transketolase, glutathione reductase, and aspartate transaminase, and their activation by the coenzymes thiamine, riboflavin, and pyridoxine, the pyruvate tolerance test, the leucocyte vitamin C concentration, and the activity in serum of gamma-glutamyl transferase were measured in a series of 35 patients with alcohol-related illness. The incidence of thiamine deficiency was 31% as assessed by the activation of transketolase, and 55% as assessed by the pyruvate tolerance test. The incidence of riboflavin deficiency was 23% and of ascorbic acid deficiency 91%. No cases of pyridoxine deficiency were detected. The pyruvate tolerance test was found to be a more sensitive test of thiamine deficiency than the transketolase activation, and the activation of red blood cell aspartate transaminase was found to be a poor indicator of pyridoxine deficiency. There was a poor correlation of the gamma-glutamyl transferase activity with the degree of vitamin deficiency, suggesting that alcohol exposure is only partly responsible for the observed vitamin deficiency.",
      "Inactive 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase in broken cell preparations of various mammalian tissues and cell cultures. Preincubation of broken cell preparations from a variety of tissues and cell cultures resulted in an apparent increase in the level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. However, apparent activation of the reductase in mouse liver, hepatomas and primary liver cell cultures was attributed largely to the loss, during the preincubation period, of an interfering enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase. Among non hepatic cells and tissues (which did not contain appreciable lyase activity) the proportion of latent reductase was high in sonicates of fetal brain and in L cells and was independent of the level of total enzyme activity present. Activation of the reductase was blocked by hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA and NADPH as well as by KF so that activation did not occur under the conditions of the enzyme assay. The enzyme was activated slowly at 4 degrees C, so that partial activation of the latent form occurred during isolation of the microsomal fraction by differential centrifugation. The reductase present in sonicates of cells with either a high or low proportion of the latent enzyme was inactivated by incubation with ATP and Mg2+. Suppression of reductase activity in L cell cultures by treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol and an age-related decline in brain enzyme activity did not involve reversible conversion of the reductase to an inactive form."

      "Diagnosis and treatment: drugs five years later. Amoxicillin. Amoxicillin is an aminopenicillin available in the United States only for oral use. It has an antibacterial activity and spectrum similar to that of ampicillin and is destroyed by gram-positive and gram-negative beta-lactamases. It is more active against enterococci and salmonellae than ampicillin, but less active against Shigella. It is better absorbed than ampicillin from the gastrointestinal tract with blood levels two to two and one half times those of ampicillin. Amoxicillin is an excellent agent to treat otitis media, bacterial sinusitis, bacterial exacerbations of bronchitis, acute lower-urinary-tract infections, gonorrhea, and typhoid. In special settings it may be useful as oral therapy of endocarditis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis and as prophylaxis to prevent endocarditis. When the cost of amoxicillin approaches that of ampicillin, it should replace that agent as the oral aminopenicillin of first choice.",

Claviceps purpurea PRL 1980 grew on partially dissociated succinic acid (pH 4) but not on fully dissociated succinic acid (pH 7.2). Myeclium suspended in 42 mM solution of partially ionized succinic acid (pH 4; 60.1% nonionized, 39% monoanion, and 0.9% dianion, K+ salt) over a period of 25 min accumulated more succinic acid carbon than mycelium suspended in highly ionized solution (pH 6.8; 0.01% nonionized, 4.8% monoanion, and 95% dianion). The greater accumulation from partially ionized solution was not attributable solely to metabolism of succinic acid nor to the lower external concentration of potassium ion. Rate of uptake by sodium azide and iodoacetate-treated mycelium was proportional to external concentration at least up to 200 mumol/ml. External potassium or sodium ion was not required for uptake by inhibited or uninhibited mycelium and external sodium ion and glucose did not allow concentration of succinic acid. The internal concentrations of succinic acid carbon expressed as succinic acid in cell water were about the same as the external concentrations. Uptake was not appreciably affected by extent of ionization of external succinic acid but accumulation was markedly affected. A plot of accumulated succinic acid carbon against external pH produced a bimodal curve with the two maxima corresponding to the maximal concentrations of nonionized and monoanion succinic acid. The bimodal curve probably results from overlapping of two separate curves; the nonionized form accumulating efficiently because of one interaction with the cell and the monoanion form accumulating efficiently because of another interaction. Uptake from concentrated solution is by diffusion and efflux is rapid but not complete. Efflux is not retarded by presence of phosphate in the external solution.",
      "Studies on malaria and responses of Anopheles balabacensis balabacensis and Anopheles minimus to DDT residual spraying in Thailand. Studies on malaria and on A. b. balabacensis and A. minimus responses to DDT spraying were conducted in a forested hilly area in northern Thailand. In a first phase, base-line data were collected from July 1970 to March 1972. In a second phase, the study area received five round of DDT spraying over a period of two years and at the same time all malaria infections received radical treatment. During this two-year period of field operations, entomological and epidemiological observations were continued. The studies carried out in the second phase, showed that malaria transmission decreased under the applied optimum anti-malarial measures but was not interrupted. Human ecology and population movement inside the forest, especially during the dry season, contributed to a great extent to this result. The transmission occurring in the early part of the monsoon season clearly indicates the importance of the timing of DDT spraying. A. b. balabacensis appeared to be transmitting malaria all the year round in the deep forest but only in the monsoon season in the forest fringe. The vectorial capacity of both vectors was estimated separately for indoor and outdoor populations. The pre-spraying values obtained for A. b. balabacensis were much higher thaan for A. minimus. After DDT spraying A. b. balabacensis showed a decrease in vectorial capacity estimated at 31.5 times for the indoor population and 18 times for the outdoor population. A. minimus, on the other hand, showed a much smaller decrease, estimated at 6.8 and 1.9 times for the indoor and outdoor populations respectively.",
      "Intracellular pH transients induced by Co2 or NH3. Experiments are reviewed in which intracellular pH (pHi), during exposure of a cell to CO2- or NH3-containing solutions, not only undergoes an acidification of alkalinization, respectively, but tends to return toward its original value and, upon removal of the test solution, rebounds to a value more alkaline or acid, respectively, than the initial one. A simple physiochemical model is discussed which interprets these observations both qualitatively and quantitatively. In the case of NH3-induced transients, only passive movements seem to take place; in the CO2-induced transients one must postulate an active 'proton pump'. Experimentally verifiable predictions can be made from these models. It is suggested that many physiological effects follow exposure to CO2 or NH3 may be subject to similar transients and rebounds."

      "Evidence for secretion of vasoactive intestinal peptide by tumours of pancreas, adrenal medulla, thyroid and lung: support for the unifying APUD concept. Levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma or tissue from thirty-five patients with watery diarrhoea, and in plasma of twenty-five normal controls. Plasma levels were between 0.6 and 11.0 ng/ml in thirty-one of the thirty-three patients in whom it was measured and too low to measure (less than 200 pg/ml) in the other two. Peptide levels were less than 200 pg/ml in twenty-three of the controls, but higher in the remaining two. All tissues from patients were \"rich\" in VIP (10 ng to 35 microgram per g). The aetiologic diagnoses included pancreatic islet-cell adenoma or adenocarcinoma, islet-cell hyperplasia, bronchogenic carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and retroperitoneal histiocytoma. The findings support the conclusions that: (1) VIP is a likely mediator of the water-diarrhoea syndrome; (2) the syndrome may result from a variety of tumours; (3) this or a related peptide hormone may be secreted by these tumours; and (4) these tumours may have a common embryonic origin."

      "The postcranial skeletons of the Triassic mammals Eozostrodon, Megazostrodon and Erythrotherium. The purposes of this monograph are to describe the postcranial skeletons of the earliest known mammals, and to probe, in so far as possible by osteological study, biological questions concerning the habits and adaptations of these late Triassic forms. In this context, information on the background of this investigation is useful. Studies of Mesozoic mammals, begun some 150 years ago, are based on rare and fragmentary fossils, principally jaws and teeth. These investigations have yielded a bare outline of some 120 million years of mammalian evolution-about two-thirds of mammalian history. No assessment of the important biological changes occurring during this time can ever be complete, but major advances are possible as new discoveries provide material that is more complete or that represents a previously unknown evolutionary stage. So tenuous is the evidence that at least some concepts are re-evaluated with each discovery. Postcranial anatomy offers especially intriguing prospects for investigation because associated material (that can be positively assigned to a taxon below subclass) has been for the most part unknown, and indeed even dissociated bones are a rarity. Since G.G. Simpson's monographs of 1928 and 1929, progress in the study of Mesozoic mammals has been largely dependent on new finds. A major impetus to renewed investigation came from the discoveries of Mesozoic mammals by Walter Kühne in 1939 and during the immediate post-war years. Kühne first worked on fissures in the Carboniferous limestone quarries at Frome, Somerset, in southwest England where he collected a series of teeth of the problematical form Haramiya and two triconodont teeth which were placed in the genus Eozostrodon (Parrington 1941, 1946). The fissure faunas are generally thought to be of Upper Triassic (Rhaetic) age (Kühne 1946), although Kermack, Musset &amp; Rigney (1973) believe that the evidence is insufficient to determine whether the deposits are Rhaetic or Lower Liassic. After the war Kühne carried his explorations farther west, eventually reaching the quarries at Bridgend in Glamorgan, Wales, where he not only found more triconodont teeth in some quantity (Kühne 1958) but also a symmetrodont tooth (Kühne 1950). Shortly after making these discoveries, Kühne returned to Germany and the work was continued by a team from University College, London, under the leadership of Dr K.A. Kermack.",
      "Structure and histogenesis of tooth plates in Sagenodus inaequalis Owen considered in relation to the phylogeny of post-Devonian dipnoans. The histology of tooth plates of Sagenodus inaequalis has been investigated to obtain information on the histogenesis of the tissue. The histological mechanisms of growth and replacement of the tooth plate are described in terms of an increase in area of the tooth plate by addition of denticles to the lateral margins of the ridges, replacement of worn dentine at the tritoral surface by basal growth of dentine and invasive growth of dentine into the surrounding bone at the anterior and medial margins. The histogenesis of a specialized character for dipnoans is described, namely hypermineralized dentine, or petrodentine, within the tooth plates.

The distribution of the weak acid [14C]DMO was studied in mice, 10-19 days old, by an autoradiographic technique that does not translocate or remove the compound. Calculations of pH values in areas of the developing teeth of these animals were made by comparing the photometric density of the distribution of [14C]DMO, as an indicator of pH, with that of 14C]NAAP, as an indicator of water content, which was reported in the companion paper.

The Mg2+ activation curve for PPiase was also similar. Like those of APase, these characteristics of PPiase activity were identical in the three locations studied. It is suggested that the close similarity in the properties of PPiase and APase is due to activity of the same enzyme, a concept which is in agreement with recent biochemical and histochemical studies of calcification."

In several patients suffering from congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia or from malignant hemotological disorder associated with erythrocyte pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, a metabolic study has been carried out involving the following biochemical determinations: assay of red cell enzyme activities; estimation of glucose consumption; measurement of the rate of glycolytic intermediates; and, in some cases, enzyme purification and characterization of the PK variant. Metabolic equilibrium most probably does not depend on kinetic characteristics of PK molecules. Furthermore, the data obtained allow separation of cases with congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia (hereditary defect) and acquired PK deficiencies.",
      "[Chronic metabolic acidosis in dairy cows]. Complex clinical and clinico-biochemical examination of the blood, urine and rumen liquor in a herd of dairy cows revealed chronical metabolic acidosis accompanied by rumen dysfunction and by a reduced butterfat content of milk. During the first examination of the acid-base state of the blood was almost at a standard level. An increased level of urea in blood plasma and a higher GOT transaminase activity testified to an excessive load on the liver. Urine pH was considerably deviated towards the acidic side and inorganic phosphorus was present in urine in a greater concentration. The pH of rumen liquor was slightly shifted towards alkalinity owing to the release of NH3 from urea in the food ration. The diagnosis--suspect chronical metabolic acidosis--was determined on the basis of the first examination. Chronical metabolic acidosis was definitely proved by the second examination when urea had been excluded from the feed ration. Repeated examinations revealed chronical metabolic acidosis which had originally been accompanied by a higher rumen liquor pH. On the basis of case histories and mechanisms of chronical acidosis, measures were proposed, resulting in an increase of the butterfat content of milk. Chronical metabolic disorders often follow a long-lasting latent pattern, manifesting themselves as a reduced milk yield and lower resistance; the clinical form of disease appears only at a later stage. The system of preventive diagnostics provides information on the changes in the composition of internal medium and of the faeces before a drop occurs in milk and fat production. These measures prevent metabolic disorders and high losses of produce which otherwise remain hidden for a long time.",
      "Studies of glucose turnover and renal function in an unusual case of hereditary fructose intolerance. Examination of glucose kinetics, pancreatic alpha and beta cell function, plasma lipids, urinary acidification and calcium excretion has been undertaken in a patient with hereditary fructose intolerance. This case was unusual as it was associated with insulin-requiring diabetes, type IV hyperlipemia, hypercalciuria and renal calculi. He also demonstrated the previously described fructose-induced defect of urine acidification. Glucagon and C-peptide assays showed that the pancreatic alpha cells were stimulated by fructose and that the beta cells did not respond to fructose. It is not known whether the latter was due to his diabetes or to the lack of a beta cell response to this sugar. Primed 14C-glucose infusions were used for the first time to study nonsteady state glucose kinetics in man. They showed that, 24 hours after the last insulin injection and under basal conditions, the glucose concentrations increased because glucose production exceeded glucose utilization. However, after the administration of sorbitol the plasma glucose concentration decreased because glucose production decreased. After the administration of sorbitol there was no change in the metabolic clearance of glucose. This reflects the lack of a peripheral insulin effect and is consistent with the lack of any measurable C-peptide. Glucose utilization also decreased, but this decrease was less than the decrease in glucose production. Because the metabolic clearance of glucose remained unchanged, it was concluded that the change in glucose utilization was solely due to the decrease in glucose concentration. The absence of C-peptide in the plasma indicated that changes in glucose turnover were not related to any changes in endogenous plasma insulin. Furthermore, the plasma glucagon concentration increased and, hence, changes in this hormone could not account for the decrease in glucose production. Therefore, it was concluded that the sorbitol-induced decline in glucose production was due to a direct effect on hepatic metabolism."

The TN-T and TN-I components change the band pattern of tropomyosin paracrystals formed in MgC1(2) solutions, although in different ways. TN-T causes the formation of hexagonal net structures, double-stranded net or paracrystals which result from the collapse of the double-stranded net. TN-I at pH 7.9 causes the formation of paracrystals with a 400 A periodic band pattern and a 200 A repeat.

      "Self-association of troponin. Ox muscle troponin was shown by equilibrium- and velocity-sedimentation studies to undergo concentration-dependent dissociation into its constituent subunits as well as self-association in imidazole buffers, pH 6.9. The extent of troponin association was found to be strongly dependent on ionic strength and also to exhibit a dependence on pH and temperature; under conditions physiological in regard to pH, temperature and ionic strength the extent of polymerization of troponin is considerable in 2 mg/ml solutions. The ability of polymeric troponin to bind to tropomyosin has been inferred from studies of mixtures containing actin-tropomyosin and an excess of troponin over the amount required for the normal 7:1:1 actin-tropomyosin-troponin complex. These findings should be relevant to studies of reconstituted actin-tropomyosin-troponin preparations, since they signify possible chemical as well as physical differences between the gel, paracrystalline and filamentous states of the complex that result from adoption of different preparative procedures for analogues of the native thin filament.",

Synthetic myosin thick filaments were formed from preparations of electrophoretically homogeneous myosin isolated from Chaos carolinensis and Amoeba proteus when dialysed to physiological ionic strength and pH. Myosin dialysed directly against low ionic strength buffers formed native-like thick filaments in the presence and absence of exogenous divalent cations. The average dimensions of the synthetic filaments grown under these conditions were 455 nm long and 16 nm wide with a distinct bare central zone 174 nm long. Myosin predialysed against EGTA-EDTA solutions at high ionic strength and then dialysed to low ionic strength formed native-like filaments only in the presence of 1mM Mg2+. 1 mM Ca2+ could not be substituted for Mg2+ under these conditions to achieve native-like filaments. Filaments grown from predialysed myosin in the absence of Mg2+ resembled EGTA-dissociated myosin filaments observed in EGTA-treated cytoplasm and were highly branched, poorly formed filaments lacking a distinct bare central zone. The average dimensions of the filaments grown from predialysed myosin in the absence of Mg2+ were 328 nm long, 13 nm wide with a bare central zone 111 nm long. Under the conditions tested, myosin isolated from these amoebae did not demonstrate a divalent cation requirement for thick filament formation.

III. Correlation of the regulatory kinetic and molecular properties of the rabbit muscle enzyme. It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation.",
      "Differences in phosphofructokinase regulation in normal and tumor rat thyroid cells. The kinetic and molecular properties of a phosphofructokinase derived from a transplantable rat thyroid tumor lacking regulatory control on the glycolytic pathway were studied. The properties of the near-purified enzyme (specific activity 140 units/mg) were compared with those of phosphofructokinase from normal rat thyroid (specific activity 134 units/mg). The electrophoretic mobilities and gel elution behavior of these two enzymes were almost similar. The thyroid tumor phosphofructokinase showed, however, a greater degree of size and/or shape heterogeneity in the presence of ATP than the normal thyroid enzyme, as determined by gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Kinetic studies below pH 7.4 showed a sigmoid response curve for both enzymes when the velocity was determined at 1 mM ATP with varying levels of fructose-6-P. The interaction coefficient, however, was 4.2 and 2.6 for normal and tumor thyroid phosphofructokinase, respectively. Ammonium sulfate decreased the cooperative interactions with the substrate fructose-6-P in both enzymes. The thyroid tumor enzyme, however, was less sensitive to the inhibition by ATP and by citrate. The reversal of citrate inhibition by cyclic 3':5'-adenosine monophosphate was also less effective with the thyroid tumor phosphofructokinase, while the protective effect of fructose-6-P was stronger. The difference in citrate inhibition between tumor and normal thyroid enzyme was not strongly affected by varying the MgCl2 concentration up to 10 mM. It is concluded that the complex allosteric regulation typical of the normal thyroid phosphofructokinase is still present in the enzyme isolated from the thyroid tumor tissue. The latter, however, is more loosely controlled by its physiological effectors, such as ATP, citrate, and cyclic AMP.",
      "Pyruvate carboxylase from a thermophilic Bacillus. Studies on the specificity of activation by acyl derivatives of coenzyme A and on the properties of catalysis in the absence of activator. 1. Oxaloacetate synthesis catalysed by pyruvate carboxylase from a thermophilic Bacillus in the absence of acetyl-CoA required addition of high concentrations of pyruvate, MgATP(2-) and HCO(3) (-), and at 45 degrees C occurred at a maximum rate approx. 20% of that in the presence of a saturating concentration of acetyl-CoA. The apparent K(m) for HCO(3) (-) at pH7.8 was 400mm without acetyl-CoA, and 16mm with a saturating activator concentration. The relationship between reciprocal initial rate and reciprocal MgATP(2-) concentration was non-linear (convex-down) in the absence of acetyl-CoA, but the extent of deviation decreased as the activator concentration was increased. The relationship between reciprocal initial rate and reciprocal pyruvate concentration was non-linear (convex-down) in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA. 2. The optimum pH for catalysis of oxaloacetate synthesis was similar in the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA. The variation with pH of apparent K(m) for HCO(3) (-) implicated residue(s) with pK(a) 8.6 in catalysis of the activator-independent oxaloacetate synthesis. 3. Linear Arrhenius and van't Hoff plots were observed for the temperature-dependence of oxaloacetate synthesis in the absence of acetyl-CoA over the range 25-55 degrees C. E(a) (activation energy) was 56.3kJ/mol and DeltaH(double dagger) (HCO(3) (-)) (enthalpy of activation) was -38.6kJ/mol. In the presence of acetyl-CoA, biphasic Arrhenius and van't Hoff plots are observed with a change of slope at 30 degrees C in each case. E(a) was 43.7 and 106.3kJ/mol above and below 30 degrees C respectively. 4. Incubation of Bacillus pyruvate carboxylase with trinitrobenzenesulphonate caused specific inactivation of acetyl-CoA-dependent catalytic activity associated with the incorporation of 1.3+/-0.2 trinitrophenyl residues per subunit. Activator-independent catalysis and regulatory inhibition by l-aspartate were unaffected. The rate of inactivation of acetyl-CoA-dependent catalysis by trinitrobenzenesulphonate was specifically decreased by addition of acetyl-CoA and other acetyl-CoA and other acyl-CoA species, but complete protection was not obtained. 5. All alkylacyl derivatives of CoA tested activated Bacillus pyruvate carboxylase; acetyl-CoA was the most effective. The apparent K(a) exhibited a biphasic relationship with acyl-chain length for the straight-chain homologues. Certain long-chain acyl-CoA species showed additional activation at a high concentration. Weak activation occurred on addition of CoA or adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate, but carboxyacyl-CoA species and derivatives containing a modified phosphoadenosyl group were inhibitory. Thioesters of CoA with non-carboxylic acids, e.g. methanesulphonyl-CoA, serve as activators of the thermophilic Bacillus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae pyruvate carboxylases, but as inhibitors of pyruvate carboxylases obtained from chicken and rat liver. 6. alpha-Oxoglutarate mimics the effect of l-aspartate as a regulatory inhibitor of the pyruvate carboxylases from both the thermophilic Bacillus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. l-Glutamate was ineffective in both cases."

Interaction of usual effectors with acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7) from bovine erythrocytes was examined under conditions of high ionic strength (gamma/2 greater than or equal to 0,1). Detailed kinetic investigation of the hydrolysis of acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase in the presence of modifiers shows that the effects produced by numerous quaternary nitrogen compounds on the enzyme can be explained on the basis of binding of the effectors to the anionic subsite of the active center. The various kinetic behaviors, that are observed, are dependent on the relative values of the deacetylation rate constant ak of the complex acetylated enzyme-modifier and of the rate constant k-2 defined by : (see article) with respect to the value of the deacetylation rate constant K of the acetylated enzyme. If a identical to [1--(k/k-2)]-1, it is shown that interaction of the enzyme with tetraethylammonium, pentamethonium, hexamethonium and gallamine ions is characterized by : a greater than a and k-2 greater than k therefore, these modifiers accelerate deacetylation. On the other hand, inhibition of acetylcholinestase by methylpyridinium, d-tubocurarine, tetra-n-propylammonium, tetra-n-butylammonium, decamethonium and succinylbischoline is consistent with one of the conditions : a less than a and k-2 greater than or equal to k or a greater than a and k-2 less than k and inhibition by tetramethylammonium, phenyltrimethylammonium, 3-hydroxyphenyl-triethylammonium, N-methylacridinium and bis (3-aminopyridinium)-1,10-decane ions agrees with one of the two previous conditions or with : (see article) consequently, the effect of these ligands on the deacetylation step is undetermined. However, the effects of choline chloride, thiazinamium methyl sulfate and thioridazine hydrochloride are not entirely consistent with this mechanism but support the existence of a functional peripheral anionic site which is distinct from the anionic subsite of the active center.",

A peroperative study. A peroperative study of blood flow and flow direction was performed in series of patients with occlusive disease of the subclavian artery. Particular attention was focused on the flow variations caused by arm ischaemia and postischaemic hyperaemia and on the effect of injection of a vasodilator into the distal subclavian artery. The effect on blood flow and flow direction was measured with the aid of an electromagnetic flowmeter. During arm ischaemia induced by an inflated cuff on the arm, the subclavian flow diminished, as did the vertebral artery flow when it was retrograde. If the vertebral artery flow was anterograde, it increased during arm ischaemia. The postischaemic hyperaemia caused an increase of the subclavian flow and of reversed vertebral flow. If the vertebral flow was anterograde, it diminished during the postischaemic hyperaemia. Similar findings were obtained with intra-arterial injection of a vasodilator.

To determine whether such variation could be attributed to the use of different muscle groups, we exercised arms separately from legs using a bicycle ergometer. First, arms were exercised to exhaustion, then legs were exercised at the same load for the same duration. Arm work resulted in greater ventilation, heart rate, hydrogen ion concentration, and airway obstruction than did leg work. Later, legs were exercised to exhaustion using a load more than twice that of the arm work. Both the exhausting leg work and exhausting arm work resulted in significant bronchospasm and acidosis, whereas the nonexhausting leg work did not. These data suggest that, in arm and/or leg exercise, the relationship of work load to muscle mass is a determinant of airway obstruction.",

These dyskinesias are frequent in occurrence and characteristically are irreversible. Several biochemical mechanisms have been proposed as causes, including hypersensitivity or partially deneverated brain dopamine receptors and low affinity of the offending drugs for brain muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Clinical therapy has been attempted primarily with drugs that antagonize dopamine receptors or deplete brain dopamine. The benefits of drug treatment have been variable and lack of consistent improvement has been discouraging. Early recognition of dyskinesia should be attempted, and the dose reduced or the drug omitted at the first sign."

Determinations were also made of the rate of secretion, pH and buffer effect of stimulated saliva. Socio-economic data and anamnestic dental data were noted. The investigation showed a decrease in caries frequency in the primary teeth, but not in the permanent teeth, during the four-year-period. As in the former investigation, regression analyses showed a negative correlation between the level of education of the parents and caries indices, and that the variation of the gingival indices could be explained by socio-economic factors. In addition, a negative correlation was found between the caries index for primary teeth and the rate of secretion of the saliva and the presence of supragingival calculus.",
      "The interaction of macromolecular solutions with macromolecular monolayers adsorbed on a hydrophobic surface. In order to elucidate the general patterns of intermacromolecular surface interactions that may be involved in hemocompatibility phenomena, monolayers of representative macromolecules on an octadecylsilylated glass surface were exposed to solutions of other macromolecules, and the changes in interfacial composition were characterized by zeta potential-pH titration curves, as measured by alternating flow streaming current analysis and, in some cases, by radiotracer labeling. Experiments with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), a blood-compatible linear polymer; bovine serum albumin (BSA), a representative serum protein; whole human serum (HS), a complex mixture of proteins; and erythrocyte surface glycoprotein (GP), an extended-chain macromolecular amphiphile, showed the following: 1) Penetration of the original monolayer occurred within 24 hr in 9 of the 12 possible cases; it did not occur for BSA or HS monolayers exposed to PVP, and probably not for PVP exposed to GP. 2) In all cases, penetration was accompanied by no more than partial displacement of the original monolayer, thereby generating a mixed monolayer. Each of the six possible binary mixed monolayers could be obtained by at least one of the two possible mixing sequences. 3) In the three binary systems containing BSA, the formation of the mixed monolayer could be related to increased adsorption in the two-component system. 4) The two components of the mixed monolayers were not equally distributed across their thicknesses: thus, the outer surfaces of the PVP-BSA and (at neutral pH) the PVP-HS mixed monolayers contained only PVP; that of the BSA-HS mixtures only HS. In the PVP-HS, and probably the GP-BSA and GP-HS mixed monolayers, the composition of the outer surface appeared pH-dependent. The resultant zeta potential versus pH profiles in the latter two cases resembled those of intact blood cells. The results suggest that neither the compact monolayers of globular proteins nor the diffuse monolayers of randomly coiled water-soluble polymers can, by their prior adsorption on a synthetic surface, prevent the subsequent adsorption of other globular macromolecules. It is possible that the randomly coiled polymers may impede the adhesion of platelets to the substrate since the results indicate that the adsorption of such polymers causes a displacement of the shear plane."

On the basis of these data, the association of FD with familial lymphedema of the lower limbs is discussed: a lipid accumulation in the lymphatic as well as the blood vessel wall is proposed as a possible explanation; the hypothesis of an inborn error in the development of the lymphatic system, controlled by a gene closedly associated with the FD gene on the same chromosome can also be advanced.",
      "The response of lymphatic smooth muscles to vasoactive substances. A study was made of the isotonic response of bovine mesenteric lymphatics to several physiological vasoactive substances. Contractions of lymphatic smooth muscles were induced by serotonin (5-HT), prostaglandin F2alpha (PGF2alpha), noradrenaline (NA), histamine, dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh). The smooth muscles were particularly sensitive to 5-HT. Excepting PGF2alpha no other substances could equal 5-HT in the magnitude of the maximum response. The majority of 5-HT receptors seemed to be the D receptors. The decreasing order of the contractile responses was as follows: 5-HT greater than PGF2alpha greater than NA greater than histamine greater than dopamine greater than ACh. The contractile response to ACh was observed only in specimens involving valvular region. It was very likely that, in the lymphatics, there were 2 kinds of receptors for catecholamines, i.e. alpha and beta receptors, and the stimulation of the former induced smooth muscle contraction and that of the latter relaxation. A difference was noticed between the responses of valvular and intervalvular segments to NA. Relaxations of lymphatic smooth muscles were induced not only by isoproterenol but also by adenosine and adenine nucleotides. The decreasing order of the relaxant responses was as follows: ISP greater than adenosine greater than ATP greater than ADP greater cyclic AMP greater than or equal to AMP. The relaxant responses to adenine nucleotides tended to reduce with decrease in the number of high energy phosphates.",

Many gap junctions joined apposed supporting cells both within apposed hair and supporting cells, membrane specialization sharing the morphological characterics of both the macula adherens and zonula adherens was found. Between cells, there were short areas of parallel limiting membranes separated by a 20A intercellular space. These areas were suggestive but not characteristic of gap junctional specialization. The functional significance of the junctional specialization between cells in the organ of Corti is discussed."

Experiments reported here demonstrate that co-administration of calcium chelating agents with chlorcyclizine significantly increases both the frequency of malformations and retention of [14C] chlorcyclizine by embryos. Retention of radioactive teratogen by embryos is inverse to retention of [45Ca]calcium. These findings suggest that drug binding to embryonic glycosaminoglycans is involved in the pathogenesis of malformations produced by chlorcyclizine.",

The inactivation was prevented by including either adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or fructose-6-phosphate (fru-6-P) in the incubating media. The protective effect of ATP or fru-6-P was complete in rat or calf lenses. In human lens, although fru-6-P was fully protective, ATP protected only partially. The inactivation could be reversed by addition of fru-6-P, but not ATP, to the incubating media at 37.5 degrees C.

      "Dependence of CSF on plasma bicarbonate during hypocapnia and hypoxemic hypocapnia. We have previoulsy shown pH compensation to be similar in CSF and arterial blood during chronic hypoxemic hypocapnia in man and pony, and postulated that the compensatory reduction in CSF [HCO3] was dependent upon corresponding changes in [HCO3]a. We tested this hypothesis in anesthetized, paralyzed dogs by determining the effects of 7 or 14 hours of hypocapnia (PaCO2 20 and 30 mm Hg), hypoxemia (PaO2 30, 38 and 48 mm Hg) and hypocapnic hypoxemia on CSF acid-base status. [hco3]a was either permitted to fall normally or was held near control levels by NaHCO3 infusion. In hypocapnia and hypoxemic hypocapnia, the decrease in [HCO3] and % pH compensation in CSF were less than or equal to that in arterial blood. Most (51-89%) of the compensatory decrease in CSF [HCO3] was prevented by preventing the corresponding reduction in [HCO3]a. This dependence of changes in CSF on plasma [HCO3] required a concurrent decrease in CSF PCO2, but was largely independent of variations in plasma pH. A minor but significant portion of the decrease in CSF [HCO3] was achieved independently of corresponding changes in [HCO3]a. The contribution of this local mechanism to CSF [HCO3] regulation increased with increasing severity of hypocapnia or hypoxemia and was usually associated with a selective increase in CSF lactate. It was concluded that [HCO3] regulation in the CSF during hypoxemic hypocapnia was primarily dependent upon, and therefore limited by, the concomitant decrease in plasma [HCO3].",
      "Pulmonary vascular response to increase in intracranial pressure: role of sympathetic mechanisms. The pulmonary vascular response to intracranial hypertension was studied in anesthetized controlled ventilated dogs in which intracranial pressure (ICP) was elevated to 20 Torr below the mean arterial pressure for a 20-min period, and regulated at this level. Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) increased from control value of 2.7 +/- 0.30 to 8.3 +/- 0.51 Torr-l-1-min at the end of 20-min increase in ICP. The increase in PVR was associated with marked increase (P less than 0.001) in pulmonary arterial pressure from 14.4 +/- 1.3 to 35.4 +/- 4.0 Torr, small increase in left atrial pressure from 5.4 +/- 1.2 to 7.9 +/- 1.9 Torr, and no significant change in pulmonary blood flow. The increase in PVR occurred independently of changes in the arterial pressure. The increase in PVR induced by elevated ICP was correlated with increases in lung water, physiological shunt (Qs/Qt), alveolar dead space (VD), and with hypoxemia. Pretreatment with propranolol (1.5 mg-kg-1) attenuated the increase in PVR during elevation in ICP; the smaller increase in PVR was associated with a marked increase in left atrial pressure and a smaller increase in pulmonary perfusion pressure than in the control group. The propranolol-treated dogs also developed increases in lung water, Qs/Qt, VD, and hypoxemia. In contrast, pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine (1.5 mg-kg-1) inhibited the increases in pulmonary perfusion pressure and PVR induced by ICP elevation as well as the associated increases in lung water, Qs/Qt, VD, and hypoxemia. Therefore, a sustained elevation in ICP at a level below the mean arterial pressure in the intact dog evokes pulmonary vasoconstriction which is mediated by alpha-adrenergic mechanisms. The neurogenic pulmonary vasoconstriction results in the increases in lung water, Qs/Qt, VD, and in the hypoxemia."

Heart rate, arterial pressure and cardiac output were recorded in eight healthy male volunteers during exposure to 80 mmHg of lower body negative pressure (LBNP) in the supine position before and after beta-adrenergic and combined beta-adrenergic and parasympathetic blockade of the heart as induced by the i.v. administration of propranolol 0.25 mg/kg b.wt. and atropine 0.04 mg/kg b.wt. After propranolol, heart rate response to LBNP averaged 48% of that observed without blockade indicating that LBNP-induced cardioacceleration is of both sympathetic and parasympathetic origin. Tolerance to LBNP was reduced by beta-adrenergic blockade, since the decrease in mean arterial pressure during LBNP was exaggerated by such blockade. Although the addition of atropine markedly elevated mean arterial pressure and cardiac output in the control situation, tolerance to LBNP was not enhanced by this drug as judged from the arterial pressure response. Post-LBNP overshoot in mean arterial pressure was strikingly augmented by combined cardiac effector blockade and was in part due to a lingering elevation of total peripheral resistance, cardiac output remaining decreased for more than 110 s after release of LBNP.",
      "A review of the animal pharmacology of labetalol, a combined alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor-blocking drug. 1 The animal pharmacology of labetalol, a drug that blocks both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors, is reviewed. 2 In isolated tissues the blockade by labetalol of both alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors satisfied accepted critera for competitive antagonism. In contrast phentolamine was a competitive antagonist at alpha-adrenoreceptors only, and propranolol a competitive antagonist at beta-adrenoreceptors only. Labetalol was 6-10 times less potent than phentolamine in blocking alpha-adrenoreceptors and 1.5-3 times less potent than propranolol in blocking beta-adrenoreceptors. Labetalol itself was 4-8 times more potent at beta- than at alpha-adrenoreceptors. 3 In anaesthetized dogs labetalol given intravenously blocked vasopressor responses to phenylephrine positive chronotropic, vasodepressor and bronchodilator response to isoprenaline. Phentolamine blocked the effect of phenylephrine only, and propranolol the effects of isoprenaline only. Labetalol was about 7 times less potent than phentolamine in blocking alpha-adrenoreceptors, about 4 times less potent than propranolol in blocking cardiac beta1-adrenoreceptors, and 11-17 times less potent than propranolol in blocking vascular and bronchial beta2-adrenoceptors. This difference in the relative potency of labetalol arises because propranolol is a slightly more potent antagonist at beta2- than at beta1-adrenoreceptors. Labetaol itself was about 16 times more potent at cardiac beta1- than at vascular alpha-adrenoreceptors. In conscious dogs labetaol given orally blocked vasopressor responses to phenylephrine and positive chonotropic responses to isoprenaline. 4 In anesthetized dogs and pithed rats labetaol blocked alpha- or beta-adrenoreceptor-mediated responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and intravenously administered phenylephrine or isoprenaline to approximately the same extent. 5 Labetalol does not possess partial agonist (intrinsic sympathomimetic) activity at cardiac beta1-adrenoreceptors. 6 The blocking action of labetalol both in vivo was shown to be specific for alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors. 7 The haemodynamic effects of labetalol are attributable to its adrenoreceptor-blocking actions. The observed responses vary from one experiment situation to another depending on the balance of autonomic influences. For example, in barbitone-anaesthetized dogs, in which sympathetic tone predominates, both labetalol and propranolol reduced heart rate, contractility, output and work--effects which are attributable to beta-adrenoreceptor blockade. Labetalol differed from propranolol in decreasing rather than increasing total peripheral resistance and in causing larger falls in blood pressure at equipotent beta-adrenoreceptor-blocking doses. These differences are probably attributable to peripheral vasodilatation resulting from the vascular alpha-adrenoreceptor-blocking action of labetalol...",

Following on from earlier work, vide infra, suggesting that adrenergic blockade might influence the course and prognosis of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage, two double blind trials have recently been completed in Southampton. The first trial attempted to establish whether or not a single intracarotid injection of phenoxybenzamine improved the mortality and late morbidity of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Results suggested that it did not. The second trial, comprising two groups of 50 patients each, attempted to assess the influence of prolonged treatment with propranolol on the course and prognosis of these subarachnoid haemorrhage patients. Early results suggest that, as with the alpha-blocker, the mortality and severe morbidity was not improved by beta-adrenergic blockade."

Administration of the cleft palate teratogen chlorcyclizine or norchlorcyclizine to pregnant rats causes an alteration in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in embryonic palatal shelves. Pulse-chase experiments in vitro indicate that norchlorcyclizine enhances the degradation of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate but has little or no effect on their synthesis. These changes in GAGs are caused by concentrations of norchlorcyclizine that have no appreciable effect on DNA or protein synthesis. These findings suggest that degradation of palatal GAGs may be the primary biochemical defect responsible for the inhibition of palatal shelf elevation by norchlorcyclizine.",
      "Enhancement of chlorcyclizine teratogenicity in the rat by coadministration of calcium chelating agents. Chlorcyclizine and structurally related drugs induce a high incidence of cleft palate and skeletal malformations in fetal rats. We have shown previously that these teratogens bind tightly and reversibly to chondroitin sulfate of cartilage and compete with calcium for binding. Experiments reported here demonstrate that co-administration of calcium chelating agents with chlorcyclizine significantly increases both the frequency of malformations and retention of [14C] chlorcyclizine by embryos. Retention of radioactive teratogen by embryos is inverse to retention of [45Ca]calcium. These findings suggest that drug binding to embryonic glycosaminoglycans is involved in the pathogenesis of malformations produced by chlorcyclizine.",

      "[Histology and histochemistry of the seal ovaries and the age-related changes in the ovaries of the Greenland seal]. Histological and histochemical methods were used to study the ovaries of Greenland seal (Pagophoca groenlandica) from birth-time up to 30 years of age and mature females of Phoca vitulina and Erignathus barbatus. The ovary of the new-born Greenland seal has fetal medullary substance which is a provisory endocrinous gland producing not only sex hormones but also corticosteron. In other species of seals the intestinal cells of the medullary substance are the equivalent of this gland. Within 3-4 weeks after birth the reduction of the fetal medullary substance is completed, it is substituted by the connective tissue and the ovary acquires its typical structure. The rest of the fetal medullary substance is in the depth of the cortex and near the infundibulum of the ovary as lipofuscincontaining cells. When the maturation period approaches, the process of the follicle atresia regularly changes: the epithelium dies quicker, and the multiplication of intestinal cells increases. The ovaries of seals are rich in interstitial cells. Their amount cyclically changes. The cells producing steroid hormones always well hydrolize AS naphthyl-phosphates, the reaction with glycerophosphate is more variable. The connective tissue is poor in acid mucopolysaccharides, its amorphous substance in the ovary cortex is rich in protein. Senile changes of the ovary are noticed in the seal beginning from 20 years of age.",

Of 53 patients who had hyperparathyroidism assocated with multiple parathyroid gland enlargement, 39 (74%) had primary hyperparathyroidism without clinical or laboratory evidence of associated endocrine gland dysfunction, 2 had documented familial primary hyperparathyroidism, and 12 had hyperparathyroidism as part of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome. When last studied, 31 of the 39 patients with nonfamilial hyperparathyroidism had normal serum calcium levels, 3 had permanent hypoparathyroidism, 2 had recurrent hyperparathyroidism, and 3 were lost to follow-up. The two patients with familial hyperparathyroidism were treated by removal only of enlarged parathyroid glands, and in each, hyperparathyroidism recurred. Five patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1, were treated by removal only of enlarged parathyroid glands, and hyperparathyroidism recurred in four. Four patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1, were treated by removal of three or more parathyroid glands, and there were no instances of recurrent hyperparathyroidism. In one patient, permanent hypoparathyroidism developed. Three patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome, type 2, had total parathyroidectomies as a part of thyroidectomy for medullary thyroid carcinoma. In each patient, permanent hypoparathyroidism developed.

The patients from the families with MEA I were significantly younger, had lower serum calcium and inorganic phosphate concentrations and a lower incidence of elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Furthermore, they had multiple enlarged parathyroid glands and recurrence of the disease significantly more often. There was, however, no significant difference in the incidence of renal impairment, urolithiasis, subperiosteal resorption or large bone cysts on roentgenograms, histologic changes in bone biopsy specimens or mortality due to hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, the suggestion that this type of hyperparathyroidism has a milder clinical course is not confirmed in the present study."

Three techniques were used to compare the time-dependent deformation of microfine cellulose (Elcema G250), anhydrous lactose, dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (Emcompress), modified starch (Sta-Rx 1500) and sodium chloride. (1) In stress-relaxation experiments using a reciprocating tablet machine, none of the materials behaved as a Maxwell body in contrast to recent published work (David &amp; Augsburger, 1977). Possible reasons for this disagreement are discussed. (2) Heckel plots showed that increasing the time for which a material was under compression (contact times of 0.17 and 10 s) had no effect on dicalcium phosphate compacts but increased the consolidation of other materials in the rank order sodium chloride less than lactose less than cellulose less than starch. (3) Deformation tests on preformed compacts were carried out in diametral compression by loading compacts to 75% of their breaking force at four different strain rates between 0.05 and 6.5 mm min-1. The deformation of Sta-Rx compacts was time-dependent. Sodium chloride compacts exhibited brittle behaviour in the diametral compression test and in the 10 s contact time experiment. This was apparently due to work-hardening, following the extensive plastic deformation of crystals during compaction as indicated by the stress relaxation results.",
      "Phosphofructokinase. III. Correlation of the regulatory kinetic and molecular properties of the rabbit muscle enzyme. It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation.",
      "An in vitro investigation of the anodic polarization and capacitance behavior of 316-L stainless steel. Determinations were made of how the corrosion-resistant properties of the passive film on 316-L stainless steel are influenced by the material's mechanical and surface states, and the variable pH and PO2 conditions of the interstitial fluid. Cold-rolled and annealed specimens were surface-prepared, commercially and in the laboratory, respectively, as if for orthopedic implantation. Passive film behavior was studied by the anodic polarization and pulse-potentiostatic capacitance methods. The pH and PO2 of the Ringer's test solution were varied to include interstitial fluid values occurring postoperatively and onto recovery. The anodic polarization behavior of all specimens was found to be pH- and PO2-independent. Breakdown potentials of annealed specimens were 800-950 mV (SCE), in contrast to previously reported values of approximately 350 mV. This substantial increase is related to the influence of surface preparation and, in particular, to the optimization of electropolishing time which acts to produce a microscopically smooth surface, free of debris and disarrayed material. Capacitance behavior of annealed material for potentials greater than 400 mV was consistent with a model involving the entry of chloride and metal ions (mostly Fe) into the passive film. This entry is related to the onset of pitting."

I. Characteristics of the secretory response. The secretion of vasoactive amines from rabbit platelets induced by the platelet-activating factor (PAF) derived from IgE-sensitized rabbit basophils, was examined. The secretion required calcium has previously been shown to be noncytotoxic and was optimal in both rate and extent at 37 degrees C and pH 7.2. Different temperature-sensitive steps were rate limiting for secretion above or below 20 degrees C. The rate of secretion was dependent upon the concentration of PAF and also of platelets. Maximal rates were observed with relatively low concentrations of platelets (2.5 X 10(8)/ml), sharply contrasting with other platelet stimuli such as C3 or thrombin. The extent of secretion was dependent upon PAF concentration until a maximum of 50 or 60% of the serotonin was released and then declined with increasing amounts of PAF. This was interpreted to result from the platelets becoming desensitized to the PAF, a process that shuts off the secretion. Such a desensitization was demonstrated and was shown to be stimulus specific, i.e., other stimuli could still induce secretion from PAF-desensitized platelets. PAF extracted with ethanol from the albumin to which it is usually bound during preparation, exhibited similar characteristics, except that secretion of up to 90% of the serotonin was induced. The extracted PAF thus seemed less able to induce the desensitization. Its use did provide important evidence that populations of rabbit platelets are relatively homogenous in their ability to respond to PAF.",
      "Eosinophil chemotactic factor. Release from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils by arachidonic acid. An eosinophil chemotactic factor (ECF) can be released from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils by arachidonic acid (AA), its methyl ester, but not by other derivatives such as AA ethyl ester and arachidonyl acetate. The ECF is highly specific for eosinophils and does not attract polymorphonuclear neutrophils. A dose-dependent non-cytotoxic ECF release induced by AA can be obtained from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils from a lymphocyte-monocyte-basophil suspension, from rat basophil leukemia cells, but not from human lymphocytes. Kinetic studies demonstrate that ECF release occurs rapidly with an early rise and steep fall-off at later times of secretion. The amount of ECF release is dependent on pH, temperature and medium which is used for stimulation. Gel filtration analysis as well as subcellular fractionation studies suggest that the AA-induced ECF is a biological activity either distinct from AA and its split products or representing a known or unknown conversion product of AA with potent effects on eosinophils at minimal concentrations. AA may therefore represent an important mechanism of cell activation.",
      "Platelet-aggregating factor and the aggregation of fixed washed platelets. Platelet-aggregating factor (PAF) was removed from bovine plasma by human platelets fixed with 2% formaldehyde. The degree of adsorption was directly related to the platelet concentration and the length of incubation. Fixed washed platelets (FWP) aggregated with bovine plasma could be deaggregated by 1M KCl, Evans blue, and 8M urea but not by beta-galactosidase. Incubation with 1M KCl eluted some but not all of the PAF, as the deaggregated platelets spontaneously aggregated upon removal of the deaggregating conditions. Also, fixed platelets adsorbed PAF even in the presence of 1M salt or after treatment with Evans blue. Platelet aggregation was not affected by thrombin (20 micron/ml) but was abolished by trypsin at concentrations as low as 4 X 10(-1) microgram/ml. The data suggest that deaggregation is not the result of elution of the loosely bound aggregating factor from the platelet surface, but rather the disruption of noncovalent interplatelet bridging between one or more PAF molecules bound to a specific receptor."

Administration of the cleft palate teratogen chlorcyclizine or norchlorcyclizine to pregnant rats causes an alteration in glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in embryonic palatal shelves. Pulse-chase experiments in vitro indicate that norchlorcyclizine enhances the degradation of hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate but has little or no effect on their synthesis. These changes in GAGs are caused by concentrations of norchlorcyclizine that have no appreciable effect on DNA or protein synthesis. These findings suggest that degradation of palatal GAGs may be the primary biochemical defect responsible for the inhibition of palatal shelf elevation by norchlorcyclizine.",

Chlorcyclizine and structurally related drugs induce a high incidence of cleft palate and skeletal malformations in fetal rats. We have shown previously that these teratogens bind tightly and reversibly to chondroitin sulfate of cartilage and compete with calcium for binding. Experiments reported here demonstrate that co-administration of calcium chelating agents with chlorcyclizine significantly increases both the frequency of malformations and retention of [14C] chlorcyclizine by embryos. Retention of radioactive teratogen by embryos is inverse to retention of [45Ca]calcium. These findings suggest that drug binding to embryonic glycosaminoglycans is involved in the pathogenesis of malformations produced by chlorcyclizine."

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of pneumococci is now essential to monitor for the presence of resistance to agents such as the penicillins, macrolides, lincomycins, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. In this study, clinical isolates of a selection of resistant South African strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination and by a modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion technique, using Mueller-Hinton medium supplemented with 5% horse blood. Disk diffusion breakpoints were determined for penicillin G, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and rifampin. Reliable results were obtained on disk diffusion for all these agents except for penicillin G. With 6-mug penicillin G disks, zones of strains with intermediate penicillin susceptibility overlapped those of sensitive and resistant strains. With 5-mug methicillin disks, clearer separation of strains based on susceptibility to penicillin G occurred. Strains with zones of &lt;35 mm around penicillin G disks and &lt;25 mm around methicillin disks should have penicillin G MICs determined to confirm their resistance to penicillin G.

Above this value, the logarithms of the number of viables of the drug-treated culture ultimately decreased linearly with time and the slopes of these plots were independent of concentration. A concentration-dependent lag in the time of attainment of the cidal action was observed, and the extent of this lag was related to the ease of emergence of resistant organisms. The minimal concentration for cidal action increased with increasing concentrations of nutrients and with decreasing pH. Pretreatment of the cultures with novobiocin and tetracycline lessened the minimum bactericidal concentration of aminosidine whereas chloramphenicol pretreatment increased it. Tetracycline pretreatment inhibited the emergence of aminosidine-resistant organisms.",
      "Bacterial adherence to pharyngeal cells in smokers, nonsmokers, and chronic bronchitics. Selective adherence to host mucosal surfaces is probably a requirement for colonization and infection by bacteria.

Various patterns of adherence among the different groups of subjects were found. Young healthy smokers had increased adherence of Streptococcus pneumoniae type I and, to a lesser extent, S. pneumoniae type III and Staphylococcus aureus when compared with nonsmokers. Middle-aged smokers with a long history of chronic bronchitis had significantly increased adherence only of untypable Haemophilus influenzae when compared with age-matched nonsmokers. The acquisition of pneumococcal pneumonia by smokers and the role of nontypable Haemophilus species in chronic bronchitis may be determined, in part, by bacterial adherence to pharyngeal cells."

      "Change in the classic gynecologic surgery: review of 3,300 pelviscopies in 1971-1976. An endoscopic microsurgical technique has been developed on the basis of the development of a new technique for hemostasis (endocoagulation), which needs neither ligation nor high-frequency current, and a specific pelviscopic instrument setup for surgical therapeutic pelviscopy has been created. This new endoscopic technique, i.e., the microlaparotomy via pelviscopy, opens new methods for pelvic surgery, in particular for patients with infertility. Our data show that in 79% of tubal occlusions, patency can be achieved by pelviscopic surgery. In addition, lysis of intestinal adhesions, tubal sterilizations, endometriosis-coagulation, ovarian cyst resection, subserous myomectomy, and total oophorectomy can be performed with this newly devised procedure. Our data show that in our series of 3,300 pelviscopies, the complication rate was 1.1%, and only 0.1% necessitated laparotomy. In 55%, pelviscopy performed after previous laparotomies added very little risk. In 61%, destructive heat was utilized for hemostasis. No intra-abdominal burns occurred in the entire series of 3,300 patients. With this new method, when used for protein-coagulation to secure hemostasis, not one burn occurred."

The presence of varices was associated with an increase in LES length and reduced lower oesophageal contraction pressure during swallowing and some failure of sphincter relaxation during swallowing.

      "Lower esophageal sphincter pressure in cirrhotic men with ascites: before and after diuresis. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) was measured in 10 biopsy-proved cirrhotics with esophageal varices and tense ascites before and after diuresis to evaluate of ascites might play in the development of variceal bleeding. In the 10 cirrhotic men studied, basal LESP was 30.9 +/- 1.7 mm Hg before and 22.7 +/- 1.3 mm Hg (P less than 0.01) after a diuresis which resulted in a mean 12-kg weight loss. LESP responses to abdominal compression were also evaluated. The change in LESP in response to a standard degree of abdominal compression was greater in the presence of ascites (8.5 +/- 0.4) than in its absence (6.3 +/- 0.4) (P less than 0.01). Basal gastric pH and fasting plasma gastrin concentrations did not differ during the two testing periods. Based on these data and the rarity with which cirrhotic patients with ascites complain of heartburn, it is concluded that reflux esophagitis caused by failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to remain competent is unlikely to be a significant etiological factor in the development of variceal bleeding.",

Metabolic rates evaluated from NAD(P) in equilibrium NAD(P)H transients and the required substrate levels were 3--4 times lower in glioma  cells as compared to glia cells. Both glia and glioma cells showed variability in the occurrence of intercellular metabolite transfer, detectable via observation of a transient in a neighbour of the cell injected with substrate. On this basis \"multicellular integrated states\" can be defined in clusters of glioma and glia cells interconnected by cell-to-cell contact and a mesh-like network of intercellular processes.

      "Regulation of nerve growth factor content in C6 glioma cells by beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation.

Treatment of the cells with beta-adrenoceptor agonists resulted in increased content of NGF in both the cells and the medium within a few hours, whereas alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were ineffective. The response was blocked by beta- but not alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists. The increase of the NGF content of glioma cells appeared to be mediated by an elevation of cyclic AMP or GMP. The addition to the cell cultures of other putative neurotransmitters failed to change the content of either NGF or cyclic AMP. These results are discussed with respect to a model for adrenergic neuron-glial interactions.",
      "Transient inhibition of cell proliferation in rat glioma monolayer cultures by cortisol. The effect of 3 muM cortisol on cell proliferation in rat glioma (strain C6) monolayer cultures was investigated. Cell density measurements showed that cortisol-treated C6 cells continued to proliferate at maximum log phase rates for 1 to 2 days. Then cell proliferation ceased as growth in control cultures continued into stationary phase. A 2-day period of growth inhibition followed during which cell densities were 30 to 50% lower relative to controls. Growth resumed subsequently, and final cell densities were similar to those of controls. The presence of epicortisol (the biologically inactive isomer of cortisol) in the culture medium did not alter the rate of log phase growth relative to controls. During the initial period of continued growth after exposure to cortisol, the pH of the medium decreased at the same rate in control and treated cultures. During the growth-inhibitory period, erythrosin B dye was excluded equally well (greater than 94%) by control and treated cells, and no morphological differences were detected by phase contrast microscopy. When the culture medium was replaced daily, the control cells at elevated densities continued to proliferate at a reduced rate. In cortisol-treated cultures, the period of growth inhibition commenced 3 days after the cells were exposed initially to cortisol. A 2-day period of growth inhibition followed during which the pH of the 1-day-old media from both control and treated cultures decreased from 7.4 to 6.9. Growth resumed subsequently in the treated cultures to produce elevated cell densities similar to those of controls. These results demonstrate that cortisol at concentrations considered chemotherapeutic in vivo exerts a transient inhibitory effect on C6 glioma cell proliferation."

Our case, which was diagnosed angiographically before a successful conservative operation, is the first report of a patient who survived 3 years. The pathology is discussed.",
      "[Artificial arterial hypotension during surgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms]. In studying the content of lactic and pyruvic acids in the cerebrospinal fluid of 31 patients during operation for intracranial aneurysms under halothane anesthesia, the authors established that the performance of these operations under protection of deep (40 mm Hg) and prolonged (up to 2 hrs 25 min) artificial arterial hypotension in an uncomplicated course of the surgical intervention was not attended with hypoxic damage of the brain. The danger of hypoxia developing became greater when acute disturbances of blood flow in the cerebral arteries (clipping of a vessel, spasm) occurred in the period of hypotension.",

The diagnostical difficulties of the occipital injury are pointed out, since both the occipital and infratentorial regions are \"silent\" regions for the carotis-angiography. In the case of subdural haematoma the suboccipital decompression performed in due time may be exactly as much successful as the supratentorial decompression."

As revealed, restoration of testosterone and delta4 androstane-3, 17-dion by 5alpha-reductase occurred in  the epiphyses and hypophyses; under conditions of incubation androgen hydroxylation was realized only in the 3alpha- and 17beta-positions. Organ and sexual specificity of the androgen metabolism in the hypophyses and the epiphyses was quantitative in character: the metabolism level of all the androgens was greater in female rats than in the male both in the hypophysis and in the epiphyses; the activity of 5-reductase was lower in the epiphyses of animals of the both sexes than in the hypophyses.

      "Action of androgenic steroids on brain neurotransmitters in rats. The effects of androgenic steroids on the dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) contents of different brain regions have been studied in order to elucidate the possible involvement of neurotransmitters in the negative feedback action of androgens. Administration of testosterone propionate (TP); (100 micrograms/kg or 5 mg/kg, i.p.) increased plasma testosterones, which reached a maximum at about 30 min following injections. TP (100 micrograms/kg) decreased the DA level in the hypothalamus to a minimum after 30 min and returned to normal level after 120 min. There was no effect in the amygdala, striatum and mesencephalon. Subsequent to 5 mg/kg i.p. TP administration, the minimum in the DA level was observed between 90 and 120 min in the hypothalamus, and after 120 min in the amygdala, but the treatment was without effect in the striatum and mesencephalon. Both doses of TP were ineffective as regards for in altering NA and 5-HT levels in the brain areas studied. In a dose of 5 mg/kg, androgens of different activities, such as norandrostenolone, dihydrostestosterone and androstenedione, decreased the DA contents of the hypothalamus and amygdala regions, but pregnenolone was ineffective. None of the androgens affected the NA and 5-HT levels in the brain areas studied. The data suggest that some of the actions of androgens are mediated via a dopaminergic mechanism in which not only the hypothalamus but also the amygdala is involved.",
      "9S binding protein for androgens and progesterone. A steroid binding protein fraction with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 9 S (molecular weight approximately equal to 200,000) has been identified in 105,000 X g supernatants of several androgen-responsive organs. Highest concentrations were found in epididymis and testis, but small amounts were detected in prostate, seminal vesicle, kidney, submandibular gland, and lung. The 9S protein binds [3H]dihydrotestosterone (17beta-hydroxy-5alpha-androstan-3-one) and [3H]progesterone (4-pregnene-3,20-dione) with equilibrium binding constants of approximately 10(5) M-1 and 10(6) M-1, respectively. The concentration of 9S binding sites in epididymis is approximately 10(-11) mol/mg of supernatant protein, which is at least 10(5) times greater than the concentration of androgen receptor. 9S binding protein appears to be a nonsecretory, intracellular protein and has properties different from the andorgen receptor. It is unretarded on DEAE-Sephadex chromatography at pH 8.0, and its sedimentation rate on sucrose gradients is not altered at high ionic strength (0.4 M KCl). Like the androgen receptor, its binding activity, which is maximal between pH 7 and 9.5, is heat labile, decreased by sulfhydryl reagents, and enhanced by 2-mercaptoethanol. It is suggested that because of its high concentration and low affinity, 9S binding protein may function in the intracellular accumulation of compartmentalization of androgens or progesterone."

      "Clotting in dialyzers due to low pH of dialysis fluid. During November and December 1975 frequent clotting occurred in the extracorporeal circuits of different dialyzers used in our unit. After installation of new automatically regenerating ion exchange resin columns,, the pH of deionized water ranged from 4.2 to 8.4 during 24 hr periods. Dialysate pH ranged between 5.3 and 8.2, and the patient's whole blood pHs ranged from 7.15 to 7.4 at the dialyzer inlet and from 6.2 (!) to 7.4 at the outlet. A strong correlation was seen between the acidity of the water and the frequency of clotting, and it was considered possible that the clotting was due to structural changes within the heparin molecules induced by the low pH. Following the introduction of an automatic titration device into our dialyzate preparation system, clotting with consecutive blood loss and subjective clinical symptoms have disappeared.",
      "[Coagulation deficits and hemorrhagic consequences after cardiac surgery under ECC]. I--A statistical study of the results of tests of hemostasis was carried out in patients who had undergone major cardiac surgery with extra-corporeal circulation. There were two series of patients (1.504 and 547 operated) suffering mainly from congenital cardiopathies, valvulopathies or coronaritis. Bearing in mind the hematocrit and the total protein level, the following was studied before and after ECC and 24 hours after the intervation: the blood platelet level, fibrinogen, prothrombin and its cofactors, antithemophilic factors A and B, FDP amd fibrinolytic activity. The fall in platelet stickiness is specifically pointed out, and also the fall in the level of fibrin stablizing factor (factor XIII) which is met with after ECC, and which can explain the persistence of certain hemorrhagies. Furthermore, the fall in antithrombin III level then its rise can contribute to the \"heparine rebound\" occurring in certain cases after neutralization of heparinemia with protamine. II--The deficits in the quantitatively and qualitatively variable hemostatic factors do not necessarily lead to hemorrhage. Hemorrhage, due to biological causes, are met with in 5 to 6 p. 100 of the cases. Most of the time they are provoked by a residual hemorrhage or a \"heparine rebound\", deficits in coagulation factors, a DIVC syndrome, difficult to diagnose and to treat, or fibrinolysis, much more rarely nowadays, owing to the almost routine use of antiproteases. Sometimes, the check up of coagulation can be barely disturbed and local abnormalities in biological hemostasis which are still not well understood, are invoked in order to explain the hemorrhage."

Histochemical studies, comprising staining with Alcian blue and toluidine blue at different pH's with and without preceding digestion with testicular hyaluronidase and with the Scott technique, indicated the presence of hyaluronic acid but not sulphated glycosaminoglycans as chondroitinsulphates. Myxofibrosarcoma is believed to belong to the general category of fibroblastic and histiocytic malignant soft tissue tumours. The median diameter of the tumours was 7 cm. They were divided into 4 grades according to cellularity, cell atypia and mitotic activity. The grade III and IV tumours showed pronounced atypia, often with the bi- and multinucleated giant tumour cells and occasionally with giant cells of Touton's type, suggesting a relationship to malignant fibroxanthoma. All of the patients were treated surgically and one received also pre- and post-operative irradiation. None of the 2 grade I myxofibrosarcomas recurred, while 2 out of 7 grade II tumours, 6 out of 10 grade III tumours, and 7 out of 11 grade IV tumours recurred once and up to 9 times. Metastasis appeared in 7 out of 30 patients; grade I tumours were not seen in any of these cases. By the time of follow-up after intervals ranging from 1 month up to 27 years, 14 patients had died; 6 of these had died post-operatively or of intercurrent disease.

      "Phosphorylated derivatives of phloretin inhibit cyclic AMP accumulation in neuronal and glial tumor cells in culture. The potencies of polyphloretin phosphate, di-4-phloretin phosphate, 4-phloretin phosphate and phloretin to inhibit the stimulation of cAMP accumulation by prostaglandins, isoproterenol and adenosine were studied in 2 clonal cell lines of CNS origin. The sequence of potency to inhibit PGE1 effects was the same in neuroblastoma (N4TG3) and human astrocytoma cells (1321N1): di-4-phloretin phosphate greater than polyphloretin phosphate greater than phloretin greater than 4-phloretin phosphate. The inhibition of PGE1 stimulated cAMP accumulation by the most prostaglandin-specific inhibitor di-4-phloretin phosphate was rapidly established after its addition, fully reversible after a 30 min preincubation period and independent of the presence of calcium. Kinetic studies of the inhibition of PGE1 effects by di-4-phloretin-phosphate suggest a different type of inhibition in 1321N1 and N4TG3 cells.",

Multiple villous-like apical processes protrude from the pigment epithelium into the space above each cone. Sometimes one or more of these processes is sheet-like in form and contains a wealth of intracellular organelles, including mitochondria. One or more of the villous-like procesess reaches the cone and expands to ensheath the upper one-third of the outer segment. Llike vertebrate rods, extrafoveal human cones shed their terminal disks in packets and these packets are phagocytosed by the ensheathing apical processes. The phagosomes then ascend in the processes toward the pigment epithelia soma. Digestion of phagosomes appears to begin in the apical processes.",
      "Ionic flux across canine duodenum. Movement of bicarbonate. Effect of isosmotic biocarbonate-rich solutions on the Brunner's gland area were studied by means of proximal duodenal explants in eight anesthetized dogs. Volume gain occurred with all instillates and varied indirectly with the concentration of the bicarbonate in the instilled solutions. Net bicarbonate gain occurred with instillate of 40 mEq./1.; net insorption occurred with instillates of higher bicarbonate concentration, the rate of which was dependent on the instillate concentration. Insorption of chloride occurred with the lower bicarbonate solutions and enterosorption occurred at higher concentrations. The modification of intraluminal bicarbonate by the proximal duodenal mucosa is important in the regulation of intraduodenal pH and abnormal function of this mechanism may play a role in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration because of incomplete hydrochloric acid neutralization.",
      "gamma-Aminobutyric acid: a neurotransmitter candidate for cone horizontal cells of the catfish retina. In the catfish retina, horizontal cells that receive inputs exclusively from red-sensitive cones are the only neurons that accumulate exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid under our experimental conditions. When isolated eyecups are perfused with bicuculline methochloride, an antagonist of postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, responses of cone photoreceptors to a field of light (3 mm in diameter) become much slower and approach those to a small spot of light (0.3 mm). In addition, bicuculline methochloride decreases the frequency responses of cone horizontal cells to a field of light. These findings indicate that, in the catfish retina, feedback synapses from cone horizontal cells to cones are chemically mediated and may use gamma-aminobutyric acid as a neurotransmitter. Our results also confirm the hypothesis that, in the catfish retina, a function of the negative feedback is to improve the frequency responses of the system."

      "The significance of the time interval in twin delivery. In order to evaluate the influence of the time interval on the second twin in twin deliveries, we have used more precise criteria than have been used in the literature to date. In the period from July 1, 1970 to December 31, 1974, 35 twin deliveries in our hospital were analyzed, in which both twins fulfilled the following criteria: 1. vertex presentation 2. vaginal deliveries 3. birth weight above 2000 g. We analyzed various parameters in the clinical and acidity score of the second twin alone as well as in comparison to the first twin. The following points of view were considered: 1. The more sensitive aspect of morbidity was utilized by including the assessment of the state of the newborn rather than just mortality. 2. Since Caesarean sections in twins are often performed for a fetal indication, short time intervals between the birth of both infants correlate intrinsically with a higher risk for the second twin. Therefore we considered only vaginal deliveries in order to exclude this intrinsic correlation. 3. By excluding infants below a birth weight of 2000 g, the influence of the low birth weight of the second twin was eliminated. 4. The frequently occurring positional anomalies of the second twin will deteriorate the conditions independent of the time interval. therefore we have considered only births from vertex presentations. A comparison of the acidity state demonstrated that the actual pH values in the umbilical artery blood of these second twins (Fig. 1) decrease statistically significantly with increasing time intervals. this is also true for metabolic acidity (pHqu40). The differences of the actual pH values (Fig. 2) and the pHqu40 values between the first and second twin decreases significantly also with an increasing time interval. Our results indicate that obstetricians, according to the clinical conditions, should accomplish the birth of the second twin as soon as possible after the birth of the first twin."

The purpose of this study was to characterize the sequential hemodynamic alterations and pulmonary vascular lesions produced by a single pulmonary artery injection of the vasotoxic pyrrolic alkaloid dehydromonocrotaline in the young beagle. Normotensive pulmonary pressure was replaced by hypertension 21 days after injection. By 28 days, the pulmonary pressure and total pulmonary vascualr resistance of the experimental animals were significantly greater than the controls (p less than 0.01). Right ventricular work increased from a baseline mean of 0.58 to 1.40 kg . m/min. Morphological and morphometrical analyses revealed alveolar edema, increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, cellular hyperplasia in the alveolar septa, and a progressive interstitial fibrosis. The precise mechansims by which dehydromonocrotaline injection initiates and promotes pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis still needs clarification; however, our data indicate that the fraction of air space is reduced relative to the fraction of tissue space, and this change occurs with concurrent fibrosis in the alveolar septa and an increased pulmonary arterial pressure although hypoxia was not clinically detectable.",
      "Enzymes of galactose metabolism in human hair roots. Micro-methods, making use of radioactive substrates, are described for the quantitative estimation of galactokinase and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase activities in lysates of hair roots obtained from the human scalp. Enzyme assays can be carried out with fractions of one hair root. Both enzymes have been investigated with regard to stability, pH optimum and Michaelis-Menten constants. Along with similarities there were also certain differences as compared to galactokinase and galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase activities in other human tissues. The findings were used to optimise and standardise a radiochemical micro-assay for both enzymes in human hair root lysates, applicable to carrier detection studies in galactosaemia, an inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism. Because they can easily be obtained, hair roots are a very suitable biopsy material for both fundamental and diagnostic investigations of these enzymes."

      "Reoperations for myocardial revascularization. Reoperations solely for myocardial revascularization were performed in 219 consecutive patients (1967 to 1975). Indications were (1) graft failure, 46 (21 per cent); (2) progressive atherosclerosis, 42 (19 per cent); (3) incomplete revascularization, 39 (18 per cent); and (4) combinations, 92 (42 per cent). Primary operations included bypass grafts in 100 patients; mammary artery implants, 87; and combinations of direct and indirect procedures, 32. Reoperations performed were single bypass, 141 patients; double, 61; and triple or other coronary artery operations, 17. Eight patients died within 30 days of operation (3.7 per cent). Major postoperative complications included hepatitis, 24 (11 per cent); myocardial infarction, 19 (9 per cent); bleeding, 21 (10 per cent); and respiratory insufficiency, 12 (5 per cent). Follow-up for 202 long-term survivors was complete (mean 29 months). In patients who originally underwent direct revascularization, Class I or II (N.Y.H.A.) was attained in 35 of 43 (81 per cent) of those reoperated upon for primary graft failure, in 14 of 15 (93 per cent) of those with progressive atherosclerosis, and in 27 of 33 (82 per cent) of patients with combined indications. Arteriography was performed after the reoperation in 55 patients (mean interval 17 months), and 65 of 77 (84 per cent) grafts were patent. Nineteen of 22 grafts performed for primary graft failure were patent. We have made the following conclusions: (1) Reoperation for direct myocardial revascularization can be accomplished with low mortality rates although morbidity is high; (2) complete relief of symptoms was achieved in 65 per cent of survivors; (3) results in patients reoperated upon for graft failure alone were similar to results in those operated upon for progressive atherosclerosis or combined indications; and (4) high graft patency was found in secondary grafts constructed to arteries involved with primary graft failure.",

Within this material 2,055 case history of surgically treated femoral neck and pertrochanteric fractures are evaluated. An important difference in favour of primary intervention was found between the mortality of primary and delayed operations both in femoral neck and pertrochanteric fractures. In pertrochanteric fractures the mortality increased gradually starting from the day of injury. Regarding age related mortality, there was a significant difference in each age group in favour of primary operations. Thus the increased mortality encountered after delayed operations can't be explained by a selection with regard to age."

In the second family, 5 of the 11 patients with evidence of polyps showed the classical presentation of FPC, while the remainder showed marked phenotypic variation. The marked variability in frequency and location of colon polyps points to the need to reassess our traditional criteria for diagnosis of FPC.

A copper or a plastic device was placed in one of the uterine horns, while the other horn served as a control. Biopsy specimens were obtained from both horns and examined histochemically. The copper concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The fibrinolytic activity of the control horn was found to be localized to small vessels in the outer layer of the uterine wall, while that of the endometrium was low. Plastic as well as copper IUDs increased the fibrinolytic activity which, in contrast with what was seen in the controls, was localized to the endometrium. Compared with the effect of the plastic device, the increase in the fibrinolytic activity induced by the copper device was more widespread in the endometrial area and was accompanied by an increase in the concentration of copper. These findings might help to explain why the contraceptive effect of IUDs is more reliable when they are partly coated with copper."

This compared patients having cancers of the oral cavity (including oropharynx), larynx, hypopharynx and lung, with controls in relation to smoking and chewing habits. Statistical analysis indicated that chewing betel is strongly associated with the occurrence of oral cancer in both sexes, and with cancer of the laryngeal region in males. No factors were strongly linked to lung cancer in men, but, in women, urban residence and miang chewing were associated with lung cancer. Analysis of smoke from the two main types of cigars smoked in the region showed that both had high tar content, but there were marked differences in pH.

As for other patients, survival varies inversely in relation to the important of the therapeutic means, but in the case of the elderly patient, there is a definite difference in the correlation mortality-therapeutic index towards aggravation, so one may determine a ceiling above which survival is not possible; 2--duration of the intensive care is very important.

Didactic teaching, group discussion, individual study, peer instruction, and mass media have been employed. Health effects of smoking, both short- and long-term effects, have been emphasized. Most methods used with youth have shown little success. Studies of other methods have produced contradictory results. Educational programs for adults have included large scale anti-smoking campaigns, smoking cessation clinics, and a variety of more specific withdrawal methods. These methods have included individual counseling, emotional role playing, aversive conditioning, desensitization, and specific techniques to reduce the likelihood that smoking will occur in situations previously associated with smoking. Some of these techniques have produced poor results while studies of other methods have shown inconsistent results.

A heterogeneous profile of LH activity was found in both pituitary and plasma samples with a large proportion present within the pH range 6.5-10. In a total of 11 electrofocusing runs 7 main regions of high LH activity were found within this range with mean pI values (+/- SD) of 6.75 +/- 0.08 (n = 6), 7.33 +/- 0.08 (11), 7.80 +/- 0.09 (11), 8.23 +/- 0.10 (11), 8.81 +/- 0.04 (7), 9.17 +/- 0.05 (6) and 9.55 (2). A significantly higher proportion of LH activity was found in the midcycle plasma samples (36%) in the pH regions with mean pI values of 8.81, 9.17 and 9.55 than in postmenopausal plasma (7%) and pituitary extracts (5%). This indicates that the profile of biologically active LH in women in the fertile age is different from that present in postmenopausal women. By detailed fractionation based on narrow pH range studies and the refocusing of specific peak fractions it was shown that each of the regions studied consisted of several peaks of LH activity indicating the presence of a large number of molecular species exhibiting varying degrees of LH activity. The relative proportions of these species showed considerable differences between sources but also between samples from the same source.",
      "Neuroleptic-induced prolactin level elevation and breast cancer: an emerging clinical issue. This article reviews the evidence that neuroleptics may increase the risk of breast cancer via their effects on prolactin secretion. All available neuroleptics, including reserpine, raise serum prolactin levels. Elevated serum prolactin level increases the incidence of spontaneously occurring mammary tumors in mice, and increases the growth of established carcinogen-induced mammary tumors in rats. Caution is necessary in extrapolating this relationship to human mammary tumors because human and rodent tumors differ in some important characteristics, including hormone responsiveness. Serum prolactin levels in women with, or at risk for, breast cancer have generally been normal, and only a minority of human mammary tumors respond to changes in serum prolactin levels. Epidemiologic studies have failed to demonstrate an increased risk of breast cancer associated with the use of neuroleptics or reserpine. Thus, although some human mammary tumors are prolactin dependent, the available evidence does not demonstrate an increased risk of breast cancer in women receiving neuroleptics. We conclude that (1) additional epidemiologic studies of the incidence of mammary tumors in women treated with neuroleptics are desirable; (2) it is premature to mandate warning patients of an unknown and undemonstrated increase in the risk of developing breast cancer associated with neuroleptic treatment; (3) detection of existing mammary tumors by breast examination prior to administration of neuroleptics is desirable; and (4) development of antipsychotic drugs that do not increase serum prolactin level may be indicated.",
      "[Diagnosis of breast cancer by contact thermography (author's transl)]. Epidemiological studies performed in cooperation with the Austrian National Institute for Statistic show an increase of breast cancer in the age-group of women older than 50 years. Especially in this age-group screening for breast cancer is very important and successful. Mammography in this age-group is the most useful and accurate method. In the group of women aged less than 50 years and particularly less than 45 years the use of mammography for screening is limited because of its risks for the induction of breast cancer in young women. Therefore the combination of clinical examination and contact-thermography is a very promising alternative for the detection of breast cancer. In 133 cases of histologically proved breast cancer the high accuracy of this combination of clinical examination and contact-thermography in comparison with mammography is shown. Based on this good results a recommendation for a detection-scheme for breast cancer with a reduction of radiation exposure in young women by the use of contact-thermography is presented and discussed."

All vaginal deliveries of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University Basel (N = 4081) during the year 74/73 and of the University Tübingen (N = 3249) 75/74 were analysed using an IBM-system 370/135 Only alive singletons beyond the 28th week of gestation were analysed. Clinical management was quite different in the two departments; the incidence of vaginal operations (Basal 11.2%, Tübingen 12.6%), however, as well as the distribution of pH-values and Apgar-scores after 1 min were quite similar. Basel: Acidotic risk (i.e. pHUA less than 7.200) 13.5%, severe acidotic risk (i.e. pHUA less than 7.100) 1.55%, low Apgar-scores (1--3) 0.7%. Tübingen: :12.3%, 2.11%, 1.6%. 3.5% of all parturients (Basel) had duration of second stage of labour with  active maternal pressure support lasting more than 30 min. In two highly selected samples differing only with regard to the occurrence of cord-entanglements at birth (N1 = 1755, N2 = 1098) the association (rank correlation method according to Kendall) between the parameters of the fetal acid-base balance and the duration of second stage of labour as well as duration of the period with \"active bearing down\" was studied. Without cord encirclements pH in the umbilical artery fall --0.087 and in the umbilical vein --0.115 units and with cord complications the values amounted to --0.062 (UA) and --0.120 (UV) respectively pro 60 min duration of second stage with \"bearing down efforts\". Analogous computations for pCO2, pO2 and HbO2 are presented. Apgar-scores in these samples showed a very loose connection with the time variables. From these data the conclusion is drawn that the indication to perform vaginal operations for termination of delivery should not primarily be governed by the factor time but rather by the whole obstetrical situation i.e. the possible fetal risk of the intervention. This holds only if maternal welfare is established and fetal well being is monitored continuously.",
      "Assessment of clinical status of schizophrenic patients by the WAIS comprehension subtest. A previous study indicated that the Comprehension subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) might be a sensitive instrument for evaluating mental status in schizophrenic patients. To test this hypothesis, 3 groups of subjects were given the WAIS Comprehension subtest repeatedly at brief intervals. The results indicate that for a given individual (normal control or stable chronic schizophrenic), scores do not increase even with 4 consecutive weeks of testing. In contrast, a group of schizophrenic patients tested shortly after readmission and again after being established on neuroleptic medication showed a marked improvement in scores which, somewhat surprisingly, were not correlated with changes in global ratings of disordered thinking by the treating psychiatrist. This standardized test may offer a convenient objective technique for quantifying some aspects of thinking in schizophrenic patients.",
      "Response of fetal acid--base balance to duration of second stage of labour. Data from 4081 vaginal deliveries (no caesarean sections) were analyzed retrospectively (IBM 730/158) with regard to duration of second and \"final stage\" of labour and fetal outcome (acid-base balance and apgar scores). The average duration of the two periods amounted to 22.8+/-29.6 and 9.9+/-7.8 min. Mean pH (UA) was 7.268+/-0.084 and the acidotic risk (pH less than 7.20, pH less than 7.10) 13.4 and 1.6% respectively. The distribution of the Apgar-scores after 1 min was assessed: 0-3: 1.7%, 4-6: 5.4%, 7-10: 92.9%. The dependance of the time variables from parity was studied. Two samples (N1=1755, N2=1098) of uncomplicated term pregnancies were chosen according to 7 clinical selection criteria differing only in the presence of cord entanglements at birth. The association between the two time variables and parameters of the fetal acid-base balance in cord blood was evaluated using rank correlation- and polynomial regression analysis. Highly significant correlations (tau) were found between the variable time and actual pH in blood of the umbilical artery and vein as well as pCO2, BEECF and HbO2 in the umbilical vein. The association however is not very close and thus clinically not of great importance. The deltapH (UA &amp; UV) pro 60 min of second (and \"final\") stage of labour was computed and amounted to -0.024 (-0.087) in blood of the umbilical artery and -0.036 (-0.115) in blood of the umbilical vein and -0.017 (-0.062) (UA) and -0.032 (-0.120) units (UV) in the sample with and without apparent cord entanglements at birth respectively. The response of fetal acid-base balance to cord compression during second stage of labour was assesses: The acidotic risk (pH less 7.2) was doubled: 14.5% (7.7%) and AV-differences of all variables were \"opened\" if cordcoilings were observed. Apgar scores were not significantly different. Moreover, the association between AV-differences of each parameter and the variable time was studied: it became evident that with passage of time AV-difference is \"closed\" (-0.052 AV DpH/60 min \"final stage\" of labour, N=1098) indicating time related impairment of placental function. From these observations and data of the literature the conclusion is drawn that second stage of labour should not exceed 45 min in any patient. Furthermore it is concluded that in cases without signs of impending fetal distress it seems to be possible to wait more than 20 (Multipara) or 30 min (Primipara) duration of \"final stage\" without increased risk of fetal peril measured in terms of acidemia and clinical depression. This is valid only in term pregnancies with the possibility of continuous monitoring of FHR, in cases with normal uterine activity, uneventful course of first stage of labour and cooperative, vigorous patients. The indications for termination of delivery by vaginal operations in cases without impending fetal distress are discussed."

The former species attained a greater population density (approximately 6 X 10(7) organisms/ml) than the latter (approximately 2 X 10(7) organisms/ml). Greater numbers of epimastigotes, some in active binary divisions, were observed during the logarithmic phase of growth, and morphologic changes occurred during cultivation which correlated with increased acidity and a depletion of glucose. Maximum numbers of trypomastigote forms were found during the stationary and early death phases. Most of the forms observed after 20 days were sphaeromastigotes. Glucose concentrations decreased to 0 M in T. vespertilionis and to 4.4 X 10(-5) M in T. dionisii cultures during the stationary and death phases.

      "[Regulation processes in biological systems. II. Role of compartmentation and of organized multienzyme systems]. The picture, emerging from the experimental results on the physical association of multienzyme systems, is that the true physiological significance of the aggregated state can be understood only if it is correlated to the structural and functional integration of the cellular metabolic framework as a whole. The enzyme clusters exhibit two distinct functional properties. The first is the spatial translocation of intermediate substrates, the effect of which may be viewed as metabolic \"channelling\" or \"vectorial catalysis\" if the enzyme clusters are arrayed in some manner in the cell. The second is the coordinate regulation which represents an efficient and economical mean of controlling two or more functionally related enzymes. The common element to these two properties is the spatial character, which is potentially present in the function and the regulation of the intermediary metabolism. The biological systems, and metabolism in particular, exhibit both stability and variability; the latter sometimes assumes the character of periodicity. Whether the oscillations have a definite importance at the level of the intermediary metabolism itself, may well be questioned; the oscillatory faculties may rather serve as elements to be used in more complex functions of the biological systems. A thorough understanding of the role of clustered multienzyme systems and of the oscillatory phenomena in cellular metabolism demands a clearer physicochemical picture of the dynamic state of the living cell than we have at present. For this reason some of the generalizations derived from in vitro studies of single, isolated enzyme activities are not justified."

      "Postischemic brain oxygenation with barbiturate therapy in rats. We measured rat brain cortex PO2 (PtO2) with gold microelectrodes (tip diameter 5--10 micron) for up to 2 hours after 16 min of transient global brain ischemia with and without thiopental 90 mg/kg infused iv over 60 min beginning at 5 min postischemia. Seventeen rats were immobilized and mechanically ventilated on 1% halothane in oxygen with continuous monitoring of PtO2, ECG, end-expiratory CO2, rectal temperature, and arterial blood pressure. Global ischemia was induced by trimethaphan hypotension to an MAP of about 50 torr and a neck tourniquet inflated to 1500 torr. Postischemia, nine control rats (11 PtO2 measurements) were untreated and eight rats (8 PtO2 measurements) received thiopental 90 mg/kg. Preischemia, PtO2 values in both groups ranged from less than 5--70 torr with values of greatest frequency between 10 and 15 torr. Postischemia, PtO2 in control rats peaked at 45 +/- 8 (SEM) torr at 20 min. In thiopental treated rats, peak PtO2 was 24 +/- 6 torr at 10 min postischemia. Relative frequency histograms of PtO2 revealed that PtO2 in thiopental treated rats was lower (p less than 0.05) between 15 and 30 min postischemia. The magnitude of the decrease in PtO2 between 105 and 120 min postischemia appeared to correlate directly with the absolute preischemic value (i.e., the higher the preischemic PtO2, the greater the decrease in PtO2 postischemia). These results suggest that thiopental administered in large doses in early postischemia does not improve brain oxygenation secondary to a reduction in brain oxygen consumption. The relevance of the correlation between the magnitude of the fall in PtO2 postischemia and the magnitude of the preischemic value is discussed.",
      "Time course of changes of extracellular H+ and K+ activities during and after direct electrical stimulation of the brain cortex. The kinetics of H+ and K+ activities were recorded during and after direct electrical activation of the brain cortex (cat). H+ activity was measured with H+-sensitive glass microelectrodes (tip diameters of 1--4 micron) and K+ activity was registered with double-barrelled ion-sensitive microelectrodes (tip diameters of 1--3 micron). It could be shown that extracellular H+ activity initially decreased for a few seconds and increased only after the 7.s. Maximum acidosis was always noticed after stimulation ended. Alkalotic as well as acidotic changes were the higher the stronger the stimulation parameters were. K+ activity increased very rapidly after stimulation began, reached its maximum when stimulation ended and then decreased to its initial value with an undershoot. It is concluded that the functional hyperemia of microflow could be triggered by the rapid increase in K+ activity, whereas the initial alkalotic change of extracellular pH means that H+ activity does not play a role in the first phase of this kind of hyperemia. The alkalotic shift is interpreted to be caused by the washout of C02 due to the rapid increase in microflow. In the further course, H+ activity obviously contributes to the maintenance of functional hyperemia. In this later period K+ activity is always below the control value."

Results showed that almost one half of the sample disagreed with the instructor rating applied to their nonverbal skills with patients. The differences between the groups was significant at the 0.05 level and the students were accurate in designating the direction of difference. Results are discussed in relation to clinical evaluation by both faculty and students in appraising communication skills. Implications such as grade inflation are discussed and recommendations for further study are covered."

      "[Cerebral manifestations in the hepatic coma syndrome (author's transl)]. The pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy has been investigated in a two-stage devascularization model in the rat with portavacal shunt and hepatic artery ligation. There is a significant increase in brain octopamine and phenylethanolamine and a decrease in brain norepinephrine (NE) 6 to 9 hours after hepatic artery ligation. The depletion of NE seems the sequel of diminished synthesis in the presence of an unaltered turnover rate, due to a blockade of tyrosine hydroxylase either by accumulation of false neurochemical transmitters or by phenylalanine. It is most marked in the cortex and midbrain. The high-energy phosphate compounds, ATP, phosphocreatine and glucose-6-phosphate are not diminished in hepatic coma, nor is glucose, indicating that other mechanism are involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic state by the increased ammonia level. \"intestinal sterilization\" and total colectomy have no significant effect on the ammonia level, but cause a decrease in the level or aromatic precursor amino acids in the plasma and brain, with normalization of the level of cerebral transmitters. These results permit the formulation of a unified concept of the hepatic coma syndrome and its clinical manifestations such as flapping tremor, the hyperdynamic cardiovascular state and the hepatorenal syndrome. Moreover, they form the basis for the introduction of a new therapeutic principle in the management of hepatic encephalopathy by L-dopa or modified amino acid solutions, which act by altering the central and peripheral neurotransmitters.",
      "Deranged tyrosine metabolism in cirrhosis. In normal individuals, the main route for tyrosine degradation is the hepatic pathway tyrosine→4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid→homogentisic acid→CO(2). Quantitatively minor pathways, in large part extrahepatic, are: tyrosine→tyramine→octopamine and tyrosine→dopa→catecholamines.In cirrhosis, the main hepatic pathway is blocked to varying degrees at the first three stages. This appears to be due to lack of activity of the enzymes tyrosine transaminase, PHPA oxidase, and HGA oxidase, the first step being rate limiting. Hypertyrosinemia and tyrosine intolerance result.With the main hepatic pathway partially blocked, an abnormally large amount of tyrosine passes into the normally minor extrahepatic pathway leading to the false neurotransmitters tyramine and octopamine. Overproduction of these amines ensues and they accumulate in the body fluid.The false neurotransmitters can displace catecholamines from their storage sites in the peripheral and central nervous system, and thereby disrupt adrenergic processes in arterioles, kidneys, and brain. Their accumulation in cirrhotic patients may play a role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, and hyperdynamic circulation."

      "[Role of the anesthetic consultation in an organization model of the anesthesia-resuscitation department]. The anaesthetic consultation is essential to give patients a sense of security. It should be organised taking into account the needs and resources of the department. In the light of the experience of the authors in an anti-cancer center, three main principles can be enumerated for this to be properly organised: the detachment of doctors from the surgical departments, a rotation in the department and a timetable for the consultations. The part played by the departments requesting help and the different secretarial offices is important. In this way one can anticipate and eliminate the improvisation which always occurs, to the detriment of the patient. Collaboration between the different departments involved is naturally indispensable. These general principles have beeen stated for at least a dozen or so years by a certain number of anaesthetists. It was quite easy to stranspose these principles and to adapt them to the organisation of the anti-cancer struggle. Such applications should be generalised.",
      "A systems analysis of the impact of physician extenders on medical cost and manpower requirements. This paper presents a descriptive narrative of a mathematical manpower model and the results of an analysis of the effect physician extenders have on medical costs and manpower requirements. The model is extensively developed, through the use of a new medical classification system in the area of delegation of specific task areas and patient visits to physician extenders. Additionally the models incorporate a complete cost structure for a group practice. Field trials in seven HMOs indicate that the models accurately represent the actual system and can be used effectively as planning aids. Results are presented that analyze the use of physician extenders from the following viewpoints: minimum cost solution for adult medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics/gynecology (OB/GYN); maximum physician extender use; effect of physician extender salary on minimum cost utilization; level of independence exercised; size of clinic and regional manpower planning; and a case study of HMO planning. The type of results presented include cost analysis, manpower analysis, and the types of patient visits best delegated to physician extenders (PE)."

A double-blind study including three different cardioselective beta-blockers, practolol, H 87/07 and metoprolol, was performed in 54 patients with acute myocardial infarction and chest pain shortly after onset of symptoms. Transmural infarctions were found in 42 patients while 12 patients had nontransmural infarctions. Chest pain and the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly reduced in the beta-blocker groups whereas no changes were seen after saline. All patients with nontransmural infarctions and 14 out of 29 with transmural infarctions got pain relief lasting for at least 30 min. None of the patients developed signs of left ventricular backward failure, shock, or bradycardia. A decrease in ST segment elevation was observed in all the transmural infarctions after beta-blockade. No changes in ST segment elevation were found after analgesics when given after saline, but in some cases an increase was seen in this parameter when analgesics were given due to insufficient pain relief after beta-blockers or due to return of chest pain. It is suggested that pain relief by beta-blockers indicates decrease of myocardial ischemia.",
      "Evaluation of a dual-function pH and PCO2 in vivo sensor. A newly developed, dual-function pH and PCO2 sensor was evaluated in this study. The sensors were placed in the femoral arteries of dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Comparisons were made between systemic arterial pH and PCO2 measured using the sensor and those measured from blood samples drawn at 15-min intervals over a 7-h period using a bench instrument. The mean pH of the bench instrument measurements was 7.43. The mean difference of the sensor measurements from the bench instrument measurements for 207 comparisons was 0.0003 pH +/- 0.061 SD. The mean PCO2 of the bench instrument measurements was 40 mmHg. The mean difference of the sensor measurements from those of the bench instrument for 212 comparisons was -1.43 mmHg +/- 5.17 SD. The sensors performed equally well in the presence of metabolic or respiratory acidosis and alkalosis. The dual-function sensors evaluated in this study are useful for trend monitoring of pH and PCO2 over at least a 7-h period without recalibration. With improvement in the consistency of sensor construction, these sensors will be reliable in vivo sensing devices for blood pH and PCO2 and thus valuable research and clinical instruments.",

The fragility of these patients leads one to consider the following parameters: 1--the degree of resuscitation is assessed by quantification of the therapeutic means. As for other patients, survival varies inversely in relation to the important of the therapeutic means, but in the case of the elderly patient, there is a definite difference in the correlation mortality-therapeutic index towards aggravation, so one may determine a ceiling above which survival is not possible; 2--duration of the intensive care is very important. In most cases, the decisive point is situated on the 3rd or 4th day of care, at which time the decision to continue or stop treatment may be considered in the light of the patient's progress."

Cervical tears extending into the lower uterine segment or into the broad ligament occurred in 4 cases, lower segment tears in 6 and a fundal tear in 1. One patient died of respiratory failure. The possible cause of uterine rupture with vacuum extraction appear to be a combination of an unengaged fetal head, an incompletely dilated cervix and an undetected mild cephalopelvic disproportion especially in grandmultiparae, dehiscent or weak uterine scars, prolonged traction without progress, manipulations in shoulder dystocia and obstruction and excessive non controlled traction.

A total of 1,367 nonstress tests in 284 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Three groups of patients were delineated with respect to the fetal heart rate scores. When the group with the highest score of 8 to 10 and a perinatal mortality rate (PNM) rate of 4.7/1,000 was compared with the groups having intermediate (5 to 7) and low (less than or equal to 4) scores, there was a highly significant increase in PNM to 69.8/1,000 (p less than 0.01) and 433/1,000 (p less than 0.001), respectively. A significant increase in low Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes, in fetal acidosis (low umbilical arterial pH), and in duration of intensive care nursery stay was also seen as the fetal heart rate score progressively deteriorated from the 8 to 10 group to the less than or equal to 4 group.

Human fetal tissues derived from prostaglandin-induced abortuses (9--18 wk fertilization age) have been utilized to evaluate sphingolipid composition and catabolism.

Sphingolipid catabolism was evaluated in fetal lung and brain through the measurement of relevant acid hydrolases (arylsulfatase A, beta-galactosidase, and hexosaminidase). During the fetal period studied, the parameters of sphingolipid composition revealed variability but no consistent pattern of change. Each acid hydrolase was readily detected. Enzyme specific activities revealed no variation during the 9 fetal wk studied. Cellulose acetate electrophoresis yielded the anticipated isoenzyme patterns for each acid hydrolase with little variation during the period of study. The compositional values support current concepts of cerebral development during this period of fetal life. Together with the catabolic analyses, these studies provide normative data relative to the assessment of metabolic abnormalities during this period of fetal development."

      "[Equilibrium dynamics of the 3-dimensional structure of globular proteins]. According to the data of many physical and physico-chemical methods for conditions near to physiological, there are two types of spontaneous reversible conformational transitions in native proteins namely, local transconformations and overall unfolding of the molecule. Conformational transitions of both types occur with correlation times of less than 10-1--10-3 sec. Some local transconformations, especially those revealed by the hydrogen exchange method, are characterized by weak temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant (local temperature-independent (TI) transconformations). Combining the data obtained by the hydrogen exchange method with recently published results of energy refinement of protein structure leads us to suggest that the probability of local TI-transconformations is independent of hydrophobic forces and possibly related to the \"internal\" conformational free energy of the native protein, i.e. the sum of (1) the potentional energy of non-bonded intramolecular interactions, (2) the energy of dihedral and bond angle strain as well as (3) the entropy of the folded protein. In the proposed model of dynamic structure the cooperative nature of local TI-transconformations is a result of close interrelation between the optimization of van der Waals side chain interactions in the nonpolar core and variation of dihedral and valence angles. It is shown that the local TI-conformers are closely related to the functionally important transient key states of native proteins.",
      "Frequencies of pneumococcal types causing serious infections in patients admitted to the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, 1969-77. During a 7 1/2 year period pneumococci were isolated from body fluids of 124 patients at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford -72 with pneumonia, 26 with meningitis and 26 with other serious infections. Eighty-one (65%) of the patients were over 50, and 33 (27%) were over 70 years old. Of the 124 pneumococcal strains 104 (84%), including 23 (79%) of those from patients who died, belonged to types included in the vaccines successfully used in South Africa and in Papua New Guinea. The relative frequencies of types in the Oxford series and in a larger British series agreed closely with those found in a recent survey of 3644 bacteraemic pneumococcal infections in 10 American cities. Any polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine licensed for use in the United States is thus likely to be relevant to the situation in Britain."

      "Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with tolmetin: a comparison with alclofenac. A double-blind between-patient trial over 6 weeks to compare the effects of 1.6 g tolmetin daily with 4 g alclofenac daily was completed by 37 out of 44 out-patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Tolmetin proved as effective as alclofenac in relieving pain and in reducing both the articular index score and the number of inflamed joints. However, alclofenac produced a significantly greater reduction in the duration of morning stiffness, which could have been related to the timing of the initial daily dose of tolmetin. Onset of fatigue was significantly improved by both drugs. Neither treatment group exhibited any significant changes in the serum levels of IgG, IgA, and IgM, nor in the latex and sheep-cell agglutination titres. Although neither drug gave rise to serious side-effects, 3 patients (2 on tolmetin, 1 on alclofenac) were withdrawn because of skin rash, 2 (on tolmetin) because of gastro-intestinal upsets, and 1 from each group because of lack of analgesic effects.",
      "Carboxypeptidase displaying differential velocity in hydrolysis of methotrexate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid, and leucovorin. An enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of folic acid and the antifolate methotrexate nearly 20 times more rapidly than the hydrolysis of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was extraced from a gram-negative bacterium tentatively identified as a Flavobacterium sp. The enzyme was purified 500-fold and found to have a molecular weight of about 53,000. Apparently a metallo-enzyme, it is inhibited by citrate and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Ca2+, Co2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+ reverse inhibition by EDTA, whereas Ca2+ and Zn2+ are weak activators in the absence of EDTA. The enzymatic reaction releases the carboxy-terminal glutamyl moiety of derivatives of pteroyl-mono-L-glutamic acid. Substituents on N5 of the pteridine ring decrease the velocity of hydrolysis. Some non-specificity for the terminal amino acid is expressed. The strikingly different rates of hydrolysis of methotrexate and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate have stimulated interest in this enzyme for its potential clinical value in improving the therapeutic index of methotrexate."

The results indicate that pharmacists are being asked about learning disabilities. Overall, 53% of the pharmacists responding had been asked about learning disabilities by parents, physicians, teachers or others. No significant interactions were found between the type of practice and age, and no significant main effect for type of practice was found in the ANOVA results for knowledge scores or attitude scores. Even though there were no differences owing to age in pharmacists' knowledge of learning disabilities, age was found to have a significant effect on attitudes toward increased pharmacist involvement in monitoring behaviors of learning-disabled children; the younger groups had a more positive attitude. The pharmacist seems to have the knowledge and attitudes required to become more actively involved in monitoring the medications and behaviors of children with learning disabilities.",

The tests were based upon the assumption that the viewpoints of the periodontal teachers are the correct ones and can be used to identify the affective objectives. The results of the present study indicate that the students' attitudes changed and became similar to the viewpoints of the faculty as an effect of the discussion seminars. This observation speaks in favor of the use of such seminars for effective teaching as a supplement to didactic teaching and clinical instruction."

Transmural infarctions were found in 42 patients while 12 patients had nontransmural infarctions. Chest pain and the product of heart rate and systolic blood pressure were significantly reduced in the beta-blocker groups whereas no changes were seen after saline. All patients with nontransmural infarctions and 14 out of 29 with transmural infarctions got pain relief lasting for at least 30 min. None of the patients developed signs of left ventricular backward failure, shock, or bradycardia. A decrease in ST segment elevation was observed in all the transmural infarctions after beta-blockade. No changes in ST segment elevation were found after analgesics when given after saline, but in some cases an increase was seen in this parameter when analgesics were given due to insufficient pain relief after beta-blockers or due to return of chest pain. It is suggested that pain relief by beta-blockers indicates decrease of myocardial ischemia."

In ovarian cancer, only CEA and PLAP levels appeared to reflect tumor burden and were complementary in detecting active disease. In cervical cancer, CEA and GGT reflected tumor burden, while PLAP showed just the reverse--the highest degree of positivity being present in minimal disease. PLAP positivity was even more pronounced in patients with cervical dysplasia and carcinoma in situ while CEA and GGT were negative. The data indicate that the use of marker combinations can improve our capacity to detect minimal disease and provide information regarding tumor biology that may not be available by studying individual markers or by other means. It remains to be determined whether the use of tumor markers can influence existing therapy sufficiently to alter the outcome in cancers which are notoriously difficult to treat."

The rapidly increasing use of water for agricultural and hydroelectric development in developing countries is causing serious health problems. These can be divided into two categories; the diseases whose transmission depends on water; and the changes in the life style of the population. We review briefly the principal health problems and analyze the principles to be followed in solving them, and the reasons of the success or failure of health programs. Among the topics we consider, are the development versus health, the collaboration of health service personnel with the rest of the personnel participating in water development schemes, the necessity of ensuring a multidisciplinary approach to the solutions of these health problems, the necessity of integration of the public health component within the administrative and budgetary levels and the coordination of public health measures with the development of project from the planning phase through the completion and maintenance phases, the purely medical aspects of the health problems involved appearing as being of secondary importance. Common sense, and the use of simple, cheap methods adapted to the local conditions, and applied focaly, provide better solutions than the sophisticated, more general and expensive approaches. The time and budget accorded for surveys and research, usually excessive, should be limited. It is necessary to adhere to a disciplined use of water. Ambitions and utopian dreams and strategies of disease eradication should, in general, give way to more limited, but accessible objectives, whose attainment would lead to a decrease of the clinical and socioeconomic gravity of the health problems to a \"reasonable\" level.",
      "[Medical treatment and rehabilitation measures for the elderly--discussion of the financial problems involved (author's transl)]. The National Pension Insurance and Health Insurance Schemes up to now share the expenses of health insurance for the elderly. The shares to be carried by each body are again and again subject to political discussion. Since nursing home care is up to now not accepted as being an integral part of health care, the social welfare system is forced to cover the expenses involved to a continuously increasing degree. While it can be shown, that health insurance for the elderly has greatly improved since its introduction in 1941, there nevertheless remain elements of discrimination of those no longer belonging to the age group with access to gainful employment. Discussing different measures of solution in the context of existing insurance systems, the National Pension Insurance would seem to be the body best suited to take over the whole responsibility of financing health insurance measures for the elderly. Another alternative would be to let the pensioneers themselves come up for the costs of their health insurance, or the decision may be taken to establish a new insurance system directed at covering the risks of long term illness for all age groups.",
      "An evalutive study of a nursing center for community health nursing student experiences.

The study also demonstrated that a School of Nursing can successfully initiate and carry out health care (the service program was also evaluated) and that students, challenged and integrated into such efforts can become extremely useful as a resource to the community while simultaneously contributing to their own learning and professional development. The Nursing Services Center approach (nursing clinic that also offers home care) has been able to serve some of the preventive health needs of a population while at the same time providing students with educational experience in the field."

I. The relationship between contracture and respiration. Papaverine (Pap) inhibited a tonic tension development in guinea pig taenia coli induced by an elevation of the potassium concentration of the medium to 40 mM (40-K). The ID50 of Pap was 4.5 x 10(-6) M. Inhibition of the 40-K induced tonic tension by Pap was dependent on the calculated concentration of non-ionized form, but not the ionized form. Inhibition of the tonic tension by Pap and various metabolic inhibitors was not antagonized by raising the Ca++ concentration in the medium. Results obtained from simultaneous measurement of the 40-K induced O2 consumption and tension illustrated that the inhibition of O2 consumption rapidly induced the inhibition of the tension. Furthermore, glucose removal, amytal or Pap resulted in a progressive relationship between the inhibition of O2 consumption and the inhibition of tension. The inhibition of Pap as determined by O2 consumption was not reversed by application of 10(-4) M 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). These results plus graphical analysis of the mechanical response suggest that Pap may penetrate the cell membrane and inhibit mitochondrial respiration, thereby inhibiting this very respiration-dependent contracture.",
      "Detection of tumor-specific antigens in human mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary by immunodiffusion. Rabbit antiserum to a tissue extract of human mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary reacted with tissue extracts of normal ovary and various ovarian malignancies, and ascitic or cystic fluids of ovarian origin by Ouchterlony double gel diffusion and precipitin inhibition techniques. The tumor-associated antigen(s) of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, which were demonstrated by Ouchterlony double diffusion, were not present in tissue extract of pooled normal ovaries and cystic fluid of benigh tubo-ovarian cyst. An organ-associated tumor antigen as well as the type-specific tumor antigen may exist in mucinous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary. The mucinous cystadenocarcinoma was not very immunologically different but was distinguishable from serous cystadenocarcinoma and other types of ovarian cancer by double gel diffusion. Precipitin-inhibition reactions demonstated that the adsorbed antiserum to human ovarian mucinous cystadenocarcinoma mixed with tissue extracts of dysgerminoma and serous cystadenocarcinoma, and ascitic fluid of papillary embryonal adenocarcinoma of the ovary could not eliminate the specific precipin line developed with tissue extract of mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.",

This staining was prevented by pretreatment of sections with DNase but not with RNase or after acid elution of histones. It is suggested that at acid pH a redistribution and binding DNA of oxidized chromogen or of a chromogen-conjugate complex to DNA may account for the results observed."

Investigated auditory word discrimination skill in children diagnosed as having minimal brain dysfunction (MBD), a heretofore unexplored topic in the study of MBD.

The present study tested the hypothesis that phonemic aural discriminations would be difficult to make for boys diagnosed as having MBD. Errors and nonresponses made while Ss performed an extended auditory word discrimination task were compared between a group of 26 boys diagnosed as having MBD and a matched normal group. As expected, the MBD group had a significantly higher error rate than the normal group even when Ss were discriminating easy word pairs composed of dissimilar items (e.g., reading, math). These and other results suggested that the MBD group was very susceptible to fatigue even while motivated to perform well and while able to improve with practice. The relatively inferior performance of the MBD group was interpreted as resulting directly from a lack of auditory discrimination skill and indirectly from fatigue and its accompanying attention loss.",
      "Polygraphic sleep recordings before and after the administration of flunitrazepam. By means of polygraphic sleep recordings (EEG, EOG, EMG, ECG, EDG, Respirogram, Positogram), neurologic-psychologic investigation and questionnaires on subjective feeling, ten patients aged from 22 to 40 years (mean: 29 years), who suffered from irregular disturbances in falling asleep and in sleeping continuously, were examined over a period of ten consecutives nights. The first investigation night was reserved for adaptation of the patients and could therefore not be evaluated. On the following three evenings placebo (Placebo I) was given, then 2 mg of flunitrazepam for the ensuing three nights and placebo again (Placebo II) for the last three nights. Thus, 90 investigation nights could be evaluated. 1. Latency times until the patients fell asleep and up to the first deep sleep were reduced significantly by the active preparation. Latency times up to the first REM-phase were prolonged. 2. The frequency of nocturnal awakenings was lessened significantly. Thus, disturbances in sleeping continuously disappeared for the duration of the treatment. Duration of wakefulness after having woken during the night decreased considerably. 3. Duration of wakefulness during the total night was reduced considerably, deeper sleep stages, such as D (stage III) and E(stage IV) were prolonged. 4. Duration of the REM-phases was reduced slightly. This reduction was not significant according to the t-test. 5. According to these results, the preparation showed a clear effect. A placebo-effect can be excluded, since the improvements mentioned were not found when placebo was given before administration of the medication and afterwards (Placebo I and II). 6.

The catastrophe-reaction, the secondary symptoms, are described as the manifestation of the failure of the hypothalamo-hypophyso-adrenocortical axis, comparable with a relative glucocorticosteroid deficiency. The therapy of an acute confusional state should aim at the treatment of the underlying physical disorder and at the treatment of the catastrophereaction by injecting intramuscularly for two days high doses of methyl-prednisolon. It is demonstrated that frequently in elderly people a subacute confusion can be developed, due to a catastrophe-reaction, superimposed on an underlying masked depression.

After 6 to 8 weeks treatment the lipid-lowering effect was even stronger. Nearly 90% of the patients investigated gave a positive response to the treatment. Part of the population had undergone a treatment with other lipid-lowering agents before-most likely without sufficient success-in these cases a further lipid-lowering effect due to Etofibrat could be shown.

The enzymatic activity of alpha-chymotrypsin (CT), immobilized on hydrogel-coated polymer film supports, has been investigated. The support was prepared by radiation-graft copolymerization of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and methacrylic acid (MAAc) on silicone rubber films. The enzyme was covalently coupled to the carboxylic group of MAAc via the N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester active intermediate. Increasing MAAc contents of the hydrogel resulted in increased attachment of CT. The integrity of the CT active site after attachment was assessed by an active site titration with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). As the MAAc content of the hydrogel was increased, an increasing fraction of the attached CT retained its activity to DFP. A greater fraction of CT was active towards DFP when adsorbed than when coupled. The rates of hydrolysis of some synthetic model substrates by the immobilized CT were also measured. The negative charge on the hydrogel had a large effect on the rates of these hydrolyses. The pH optimum for the hydrolysis of N-acetyl-L-tyrosine ethyl ester (ATEE) by immobilized CT was higher than that of free CT. Increasing MAAc content of the hydrogel resulted in larger shifts in the pH optimum. The maximum rates of ATEE hydroylsis per mg CT declined sharply with increasing MAAc content of the hydrogel. This is probably related to the increasing repulsive force between the ATEE (negatively charged above congruent to pH 9.5) and the hydrogel with increasing MAAc content. The activity of immobilized CT to ATEE is small compared to that of free CT, partly due to this charge effect. Conversely, the rate of hydrolysis of BAEE, a positively charged substrate, by immobilized CT at pH 11, is almost fourfold greater than that by free CT at its pH optimum.",

Only 1 of the 6 control women exhibited an increase in the maximal urethral pressure of greater than 20 per cent after the administration of Ornade. It is believed that the phenylpropanolamine component of Ornade stimulates alpha-adrenergic receptors at the vesical neck and in the proximal urethra to achieve the therapeutic effect of reducing or eliminating stress urinary incontinence.

Environmental rather than genetic factors appear to be responsible for the causation of cancers involving epithelial surfaces, especially oropharyngeal cancers, cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract, cancers of the liver and gall-bladder, cancers of the cervix uteri and lung cancers. Epithelial surfaces which have mucus-bearing cells are particularly prone, because if these mucus cells are surrounded by an alkaline milieu over a prolonged period, the mucous of the epithelial cells is rendered fluid and is removed from the cells, of which it forms an integral part. This leads to proliferative changes with metaplasia, cell-atypia and a very significant increase in mitotic activity. Such changes are a prelude to carcinogenesis. In the case of many oropharyngeal cancers in Asia and Africa it is the alkaline slaked lime in the betel quid which is responsible; in the case of gastric cancers it is the reflux of the alkaline duodenal contents into the stomach; in the case of colon it is the absence of roughage, cellulose and vegetable fibres from the diet; in the case of the cervix uteri it is the frequency of coitus which gives rise to a highly alkaline seminal fluid; and in the case of cancer lung it is the alkaline cigarette smoke.",
      "The effectiveness of obligatory lymphadenectomy in treating carcinoma of the cervix. For the past 20 years, obligatory lymphadenectomy has been performed with the Wertheim's operation for carcinoma of the cervix at the First University Women's Clinic in Vienna. Formerly, selective lymphadenectomy was performed with the radical operation, with only nodes suspected of metastasis being removed. The theoretical advantages and disadvantages of each system are discussed, and several previous reports are analyzed and criticized. Our experience at the First University Women's Clinic shows that rates of mortality from recurrence were higher for a group of patients who underwent selective lymphadenectomy from 1946 to 1949 than for two more recent series who were treated with obligatory lymphadenectomy. Thus, the effectiveness of performing the latter procedure with the Wertheim's operation to reduce mortality from recurrence is confirmed.",
      "Cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx/larynx and lung in North Thailand: case-control study and analysis of cigar smoke. The unusually high relative frequency of cancer in the laryngeal region in males (18% of all histologically diagnosed cancers) and a sex ratio of unity for lung cancer in Northern Thailand were further explored in a hospital-based case-control study in Chiang Mai. This compared patients having cancers of the oral cavity (including oropharynx), larynx, hypopharynx and lung, with controls in relation to smoking and chewing habits. Statistical analysis indicated that chewing betel is strongly associated with the occurrence of oral cancer in both sexes, and with cancer of the laryngeal region in males. No factors were strongly linked to lung cancer in men, but, in women, urban residence and miang chewing were associated with lung cancer. Analysis of smoke from the two main types of cigars smoked in the region showed that both had high tar content, but there were marked differences in pH. Smoking cigars with alkaline smoke and high tar had an increased risk for laryngeal cancer in males, whereas other cigars with acid smoke and high tar together with manufactured cigarettes had increased risks for lung cancer. These increased risks were not, however, statistically significant."

      "Polyarteritis nodosa induced in arteriosclerotic, male and female breeder rats by chronic alloxan diabetes. Male and female virgin rats and breeder rats with naturally-occurring diabetes, hypertension and arteriosclerosis, were made severely diabetic with a single, subcutaneous injection of alloxan (10 mg/100 g b.w.), after an 18 h fast. During five months of unrelenting diabetes, some animals became obese while others became emaciated. Only the emaciated animals survived but they were blind, their adrenal glands were hemorrhagic, hypertrophied and thrombosed, thymi involuted, kidneys swollen, hearts reduced in size while testes and ovaries were atrophic. Serum CPK, SGOT and SGPT were elevated concomitant with extensive cardiovascular damage, hepatic steatosis and generalized catabolism. Circulating triglycerides and free fatty acids were markedly elevated with total cholesterol only slightly increased. BUN and serum calcium levels were also greatly elevated. Sub-normal Cmpd. B levels indicated impaired adrenal steroidogenesis. Virgin rats developed arteriosclerosis and male and female breeder rats showed exacerbation of their pre-existing aortic sclerosis as well as P.A.N. lesions in their small-sized arteries.

Elevated serum GGTP activity was the single most common biochemical abnormality (74%) and, when present was accompanied by histological abnormalities in all but one case. In seven patients, including two with alcoholic cirrhosis, this was the only biochemical abnormality. The mean serum GGTP was highest in the cirrhotic group. There was some correlation between serum GGTP activity and the degree of histological hepato-cellular necrosis. The values showed a wide scatter, however, and 12 patients had normal serum GGTP activity when histological damage was present. While elevated serum GGTP levels in alcoholism may be partly related to structural liver damage, other mechanisms, such as hepatic microsomal enzyme induction or alcoholic pancreatic damage, may also play a role."

      "Bronchial reactivity in asthma to inhaled histamine during treatment with ketotifen. A 12-week open trial using varying dosages of ketotifen, an oral drug with a prophylactic anti-asthmatic effect, was carried out in 20 patients with stable chronic bronchial asthma (age 20--50 years, no steroid treatment) to determine whether the frequency of asthma attacks and bronchodilator consumption could be reduced, and whether pulmonary function would improve. The protective action of ketoifen against a histamine inhalation test was measured at the beginning of the trial and at regular intervals during the trial. The patients experienced a significant improvement in their asthma and a significant decrease in the number of asthma attacks during the trial. Concomitantly, the need for other anti-asthma agents was reduced. Pulmonary function tests improved before and following histamine inhalation after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment. In some patients cromoglycate was successfully replaced by ketotifen. Efficacy was rated as very good or good in 17 patients and moderate in 3 patients. Tolerance was good in all patients, no serious side-effects were observed. Summing up, it may be stated that ketotifen is a compound which by virtue of its activity profile and route of administration offers a new approach to the prophylactic treatment of bronchial asthma.",
      "[Exercise test in the asthmatic patient. Study of 75 patients]. Frequency of exercise-induced asthma has been studied in 75 unselected asthmatic patients (adults and children) by measuring the forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV1) and the vital capacity (VC) before and after a treadmill exercise, continued until heart rate was at least equal to 80 p.cent-85 p.cent of maximum heart rate. In 19 subjects (25 p.cent), a more than 20 p.cent decrease from control value of FEV1 was recorded ten minutes after exercise ended. Exercise-induced bronchial obstruction was relieved by a beta adrenergic bronchodilator aerosol inhalation. In the group of 19 subjects having exercise-induced asthma, a significant positive correlation was found between pre-exercise FEV1 values and post-exercise FEV1 decreases. In the whole group of 75 subjects exercise-induced asthma was related to the severity of asthma and not to other clinical or physical characteristics of the subjects. From the data of other authors it appears that frequency of exercise-induced asthma is variable. The reasons of those differences are discussed."

In the initial therapy of life-threatening infections in which a bacterial cause is suspected, the emphasis should be on broad antibiotic coverage in contrast to definitive therapy, which is dependent on microbial isolation and, when indicated, in vitro susceptibility tests. In severe infections, antimicrobial agents should be given parenterally, at least initially. The need for optimal dosage is emphasized. This is particularly important when aminoglycosides are administered, for there is a tendency to use inadequate dosage because of concern for potential side effects with these agents. The problems leading to recurrence and persistence of fever during antimicrobial therapy include failure to diagnose and drain abscesses, superinfection, drug fever, and clinical or microbiologic errors. Combinations of antibiotics are indicated in severe infections in severe infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcal group D streptococci, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Laboratory aid for the selection of antimicrobial therapy can be of great value but need not always be done, because certain microorganisms have stable, predictable susceptibilities, for example, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes. Cautious conservatism is advocated with regard to the use of new antimicrobial agents.",
      "Drug utilization review in an HMO. I. Introduction and examples of methodology. An experimental drug utilization review program was developed for a health maintenance organization (HMO). The objectives of the program were to develop and implement an ongoing mechanism for reviewing drug use using criteria based on the scientific literature, and to evaluate the effect of the drug use review program on physician precribing patterns. Seven therapeutic categories of drugs, accounting for over 65 per cent of prescribing, were selected and criteria developed for their use. The drug use review prcedure is described briefly. The evaluation of the drug use review program is based on a comparison of rates of prescription use for specific therapeutic categories before and after the criteria were ceveloped and approved. As an example, data for the antihistamine therapeutic category are presented. Criteria for prescribing antihistamines suggested restricting use of combination cold preparations and refraiming from antihistamine use in viral upper respiratory tract infections. After the criteria were adopted, prescribing of antihistamines for viral URIs declined, particularly in pediatrics. In general, prescribing of combination antihistamine preparations did not change; where one combination preparation was deleted from the formulary, prescribers appeared to substitute another combination preparation.",
      "Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Fifty clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae received by the Streptococcus Laboratory of the Center for Disease Control from August 1976 through March 1977 and 50 pneumococcal strains retrieved from 13- to 16-year storage (originally isolated October 1961 through December 1964) were tested for susceptibility to 10 antimicrobial agents by disk-agar diffusion and agar dilution tests. No appreciable differences in susceptibility patterns were apparent between the two groups, and, except for one isolate, all were highly susceptible to every drug tested except gentamicin. This single isolate required higher drug concentrations to inhibit macroscopic growth and had corresponding decrements in zones of disk inhibition with penicillin, ampicillin, and cephalothin. An additional 43 pneumococci recently received from various areas of the United States and Canada were screened by a disk agar diffusion method for penicillin resistance. Four of these isolates had penicillin zone diameters &lt;30 mm, and subsequent agar dilution test results showed that the penicillin minimum inhibitory concentrations were elevated with these organisms. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of pneumococci to antimicrobials other than penicillin and its analogs have not changed substantially in over a decade. However, due to the emergence of strains with decreased susceptibility to penicillin, the screening test for penicillin resistance in pneumococci, especially in isolates from spinal fluid and blood, could be clinically useful as an aid in selecting optimal therapy."

Many of its effects are similar to those of neuroleptics: sedation, decrease in motor activity, catalepsy (which is, however, qualitatively different from that induced by classical neuroleptics), transitory suppression of avoidance reaction, antagonism of amphetamine induced toxicity in crowded mice and inhibition of stereotyped behavior induced by amphetamine in rats, and antagonism to various effects of apomorphine (stereotyped behaviour in rats, climbing behaviour, stereotyped behaviour and hypothermia in mice). At similar doses which produce the above mentioned effects, amoxapine also shows effects atypical for a neuroleptic, but which are relatively characteristic of antidepressants: antagonism of prochlorperazine-induced catalepsy in rats, inhibition of reserpine induced hypothermia in mice and enhancement of yohimbine toxicity in mice.

Neuroleptic activity is demonstrated by the ability of amoxapine to decrease locomotor activity, induce ptosis and catalepsy, inhibit apomorphine gnawing and amphetamine stereotyped behavior and by characteristic changes in monkey discriminated avoidance behavior. The fact that punished responding in squirrel monkeys was present was present after repeated administration may indicate an anti-anxiety action of this drug.

The types of extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) reactions produced by antipsychotic agents and the prophylactic use of antiparkinson agents in preventing EPS are reviewed.

Incidence may vary with age, gender, drug and dosage. The prophylactic use of antiparkinson agents to prevent EPS is controversial. Many psychiatrists believe the effect of EPS on patients is more harmful than the side effects of anticholinergics, whereas others believe that because of side effects, increased cost, greater risk to tardive dyskinesia and improper use, the use of antiparkinson agents cannot be justified. Most studies of prophylactic use of antiparkinson agents have lacked adequate control groups, adequate blinding procedures for investigators rating EPS, uniform definitions of EPS, random sampling and careful reporting of group characteristics such as dosage and drugs received. There is a lack of definitive studies of the value of antiparkinson agents in preventing the occurrence of EPS in patients receiving antipsychotics. A large, multicenter study should be undertaken to resolve the issue."

      "Plasticity in the adult vestibulo-ocular reflex arc. Human subjects with maintained reversal of their horizontal field of vision exhibit very substantial adaptive changes in their 'horizontal' vestibulo-ocular reflex (v.o.r.). Short durations (8 min) of vision reversal during natural head movement led to 20% v.o.r. attenuation while long periods (4 weeks) eventually led to approximate reversal of the reflex. The reversed condition is approached by a complex, but highly systematic, series of changes in gain and phase of the reflex response relative to normal. Recovery after return to normal vision exhibits a similar duration, but different pattern, to that of the original adaptation. A chronic cat preparation with long-term optical reversal of vision has now been developed and shows similar adaptive and recovery changes at low test stimulus amplitudes, but different patterns of adaptive response at high amplitudes. An adaptive neural model employing known vestibulo-ocular pathways is proposed to account for these experimentally observed plastic changes. The model is used to predict the adapted response to patterns of stimulation extending beyond the range of experimental investigation.",
      "gamma-Aminobutyric acid: a neurotransmitter candidate for cone horizontal cells of the catfish retina. In the catfish retina, horizontal cells that receive inputs exclusively from red-sensitive cones are the only neurons that accumulate exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid under our experimental conditions. When isolated eyecups are perfused with bicuculline methochloride, an antagonist of postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, responses of cone photoreceptors to a field of light (3 mm in diameter) become much slower and approach those to a small spot of light (0.3 mm). In addition, bicuculline methochloride decreases the frequency responses of cone horizontal cells to a field of light. These findings indicate that, in the catfish retina, feedback synapses from cone horizontal cells to cones are chemically mediated and may use gamma-aminobutyric acid as a neurotransmitter. Our results also confirm the hypothesis that, in the catfish retina, a function of the negative feedback is to improve the frequency responses of the system."

Primary repair of esophageal atresia restores gastrointestinal continuity, but does not ensure normal esophageal function. To date 22 patients, six to 32 (average 15) years after repair of their esophageal atresias, have been evaluated by personal interview and esophageal manometrics and acid reflux testing. Previous barium swallow examinations had demonstrated varying degrees of anastomotic narrowing (12 patients), abnormal esophageal motor function (11 patients), gastroesophageal reflux (two patients), and hiatal hernia (one patient). Ten patients experience intermittent dysphagia for solid foods. Seven have typical symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux. Esophageal function tests including manometry and intraesophageal pH recording, have demonstrated varying abnormalities of esophageal motility in 21 patients and moderate to severe gastroesophageal reflux in 13. Two patients have required reconstruction of the esophagogastric junction for control of severe reflux esophagitis. The unexpected high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux in these patients, coupled with their abnormal esophageal motility which impairs normal acid clearing, renders them more prone to reflux esophagitis. Careful long-term evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux and its complications is indicated following primary repair of esophageal atresia. Evaluation of esophageal function with intraesophageal pressure and pH recordings is a far more sensitive indicator of esophageal physiology than the barium swallow examination.",

The lower esophageal sphincter pressure has been measured intraoperatively in 200 patients with gastroesophageal reflux and in three patients with achalasia. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure is measured before and during repair. Calibrating the cardia during performance of the median arcuate posterior gastropexy allows a sphincter pressure between 50 and 57 mm. Hg to be obtained at operation. The postoperative pressures have ranged between 15 and 25 mm. Hg, or approximately half of the intraoperative pressure. No patient with a spincter pressure of 15 mm. Hg or greater has reflux according to postoperative pH and pressure studies. Correction of reflux correlates well with relief of symptoms. Three patients with achalasia had intraoperative manometrics during myotomy. The lower esophageal sphincter pressure was lowered and the length of the lower esophageal sphincter was shortened. Dysphagia was corrected without producing reflux. This is the first report of measurement of lower esophageal sphincter pressure in anesthetized patients. Intraoperative measurement of sphincter pressure is a safe, simple, and reliable technique which allows the surgeon, for the first time, to determine the status of the lower esophageal sphincter during the operation. This technique should be standard for all operations on the gastroesophageal junction."

Using an IBM 3741 computer, the authors analysed 592 case records of patients aged over 70 years, admitted to hospital on an intensive care unit, age appears to be an important factor in determining the prognosis of numerous diseases without, however, being a criteria for rejection of admission of these patients to an intensive care unit. The fragility of these patients leads one to consider the following parameters: 1--the degree of resuscitation is assessed by quantification of the therapeutic means. As for other patients, survival varies inversely in relation to the important of the therapeutic means, but in the case of the elderly patient, there is a definite difference in the correlation mortality-therapeutic index towards aggravation, so one may determine a ceiling above which survival is not possible; 2--duration of the intensive care is very important. In most cases, the decisive point is situated on the 3rd or 4th day of care, at which time the decision to continue or stop treatment may be considered in the light of the patient's progress.",
      "[New aspects in the treatment of elderly people with carcinoma of the urinary bladder (author's transl)]. 50% of the patients with carcinoma of the bladder are older than 70 years. During the first examination a deep muscle invasion was found in about 60%. (Stages T3/T4. This situation makes forced surgical intervention in most cases impossible (e.g. radical cystectomy and segmental resection), therefore the transuretheral resection has to be the leading therapeutical procedure.

      "Phosphofructokinase. III. Correlation of the regulatory kinetic and molecular properties of the rabbit muscle enzyme. It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation.",
      "The functional anatomy of the mantle complex and columellar muscle of tectibranch molluscs (Gastropoda: Opisthobranchia), and its bearing on the evolution of opisthobranch organization. An account is given of the anatomy of a series of opisthobranch molluscs principally to assess the change in importance and functioning of the mantle cavity and columellar muscle throughout the transition from prosobranch to opisthobranch organization. Intermediate steps are represented by living tectibranchs, of which Philine and Scaphander are investigated in detail, Acteon, Bulla, Haminoea, Akera, Aglaja and Gastropteron more briefly. Though an opisthobranch, Acteon has an organization typical of a monotocardian prosobranch; the remainder show trends affecting the shell and visceral mass, mantle cavity and head-foot, which resulted finally in the production of nudibranch types. It is confirmed that the adaptations exhibited by primitive tectibranchs relate to the assumption of a burrowing mode of life. Initial changes were the reduction of the nuchal area and sealing of the mantle cavity anteriorly so that it opened on the right, where it became restricted, the first perhaps prompting the sealing. A broadening and an anterior elongation of the head-foot produced a wedge to facilitate burrowing. Change in disposition of the mantle edge, incurred by differential growth, produced an involute shell with a large body whorl, alignment changing from erect to horizontal. The resultant streamlining eased infaunal progression; no vertical insinking of the viscera was involved. Subsequently the shell became reduced and finally lost. A section of the mantle edge enlarged to produce a posterior mantle lobe upon which sit both the shell and viscera, and which later became redundant as posterior elongation of the head-foot produced a slug-like form, the viscera being incorporated within the head-foot. As the nuchal area became reduced, mechanical needs prompted alteration to both the form and attachment of the columellar muscle. In Acteon the muscle is like that of a prosobranch, but the proximal region has broadened, a change of proportion required by primitive tectibranchs in order to support the floor of the mantle cavity formed from the section of mantle skirt which in prosobranchs lies on the right. This was followed by reduction and re-alignment of the entire muscle along an anteroposterior axis as emphasis changed from the muscle effecting retraction into a shell to producing contorsions of the head-foot. The shell, similarly reduced, instead of providing anchorage, became itself anchored by additional anterior and posterior attachment zones with, in more advanced forms, dorsoventral muscles of the body wall rather than longitudinal muscles fastening to the former. Importance was placed on the mutual stabilization of constituent parts of the posterior body region. Re-alignments of the muscle induced breaking up of the longitudinal muscle sheet of the head-foot to produce muscle tracts, best exhibited in those tectibranchs which swim; they are derived from both the columellar muscle and intrinsic body wall muscles..."

Having observed 18 cases, the authors describe a syndrome of recurrent paroxysmal atrial arrhythmia which was very homogeneous from the clinical and ECG point of view. It was usually found in middle aged males, with no demonstrable underlying heart disease, whose disorder of intra-atrial conduction occurred during sinus rhythm. The condition developed slowly over the course of years towards a maximum incidence of several short daily attacks of an arrhythmia which alternated between an atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Vagal overactivity is the precipitating cause of these attacks which are usually not completely nocturnal. The condition never progressed to sino-atrial block nor to permanent fibrillation. The beginning of each attack, often heralded by atrial coupling with a long enough interval to cause re-entry, is accompanied by slowing of the sinus rate down to the threshold level. The vagal effect of shortening the action potential and refractory period is recognised to be non-homogeneous in the atrial wall, and suggests a re-entry mechanism rather than hyper-excitability. This would explain the usual resistance of atrial arrhythmias of vagal origin to digitalis, beta blockers and quinidine. Amiodarone alone is usually effective because of the prolongation of the action potential which it causes. In 5 particularly resistant cases a good clinical result was obtained by the insertion of an atrial pacemaker with a fairly rapid rate.",
      "The effect of physiologically occurring cations upon aequorin light emission. Determination of the binding constants. 1. The effect of K+, Na+, Mg2+ and pH upon the rate of aequorin utilization has been investigated in the presence of Ca2+. 2. The aequorin light emission in a medium simulating the in vivo cationic conditions for barnacle muscle fibres indicates that two Ca2+ are apparently involved in this process for free calcium concentrations higher than approx. 10(-5) M. However, for free calcium concentrations lower than 10(-6) M, the intensity of light emitted by aequorin shows a steeper dependency upon [Ca2+] than the square low relationship, indicating that a third Ca2+ should be involved in the process of aequorin light emission, as it has been previously predicted (Moisescu, D.G., Ashley, C.C. and Campbell, A.K. (1975) Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 396, 133-140). 3. The inhibitory effect of physiologically occurring cations upon the aequorin light emission can be explained by the cooperative action of two cations, competing with Ca2+ for the reactive sites on aequorin. 4. At a given concentration, Na2+ was found to have a stronger inhibitory effect upon the aequoring light emission than K+. 5. The experiments indicate a strong interaction between Na+ and K+ in this inhibitory process, since for a given total concentration of monovalent cations, a mixture containing both Na+ and K+ has a larger inhibitory effect on the aequorin light response than solutions containing either Na+ or K+ alone. 6. All other interactions between K+, Na+, H+ and Mg2+ appear to be weak. 7. The reaction schemes used for the explanation of these and other published results on aequorin (Moisescu, D.G., Ashley, C.C. and Campbell, A.K. (1975) Biochim. Biophys, Acta 396, 133-140 and Blinks, J.R. (1973) Eur. J. Cardiol. 1, 135-142) are described, and the 'absolute' binding constants of all physiologically occurring cations for aequorin have been determined. 8. Based on these parameters one can make accurate quantitative predictions for the aequoring light response under a variety of ionic conditions, and this suggests that it is possible to determine absolute free calcium concentrations providing that the ionic composition of the solutions is known, and that the relative rate of aequorin utilization is higher than 0.005.",
      "An investigation of the ionic mechanism of intracellular pH regulation in mouse soleus muscle fibres. 1. Intracellular pH (pH(i)) of surface fibres of the mouse soleus muscle was measured in vitro by recessed-tip pH-sensitive micro-electrodes. pH(i) was displaced in an acid direction by removal of external (NH(4))(2)SO(4) after a short exposure, and the mechanism of recovery from this acidification was investigated.2. Removal of external K caused a very slow acidification (probably due to the decreasing Na gradient) but had no effect on the rate of pH(i) recovery following acidification. This indicates that K(+)-H(+) exchange is not involved in the pH(i) regulating system.3. Short applications of 10(-4)M ouabain had no obvious effect on pH(i) and did not alter the rate of pH(i) recovery following acidification. This suggests that there is no direct connexion between the regulation of pH(i) and the Na pump.4. Reduction of external Ca from 10 to 1 mM caused a transient fall in pH(i), but the rate of pH(i) recovery following acidification was unaffected. This suggests that Ca(2+)-H(+) exchange is not involved in the pH(i) regulating system.5. An 11% reduction in external Na caused a significant slowing of pH(i) recovery following acidification. 90% or complete removal of external Na almost stopped pH(i) recovery. This suggests that Na(+)-H(+) exchange is involved in pH(i) regulation.6. Amiloride (10(-4)M) reversibly reduced the rate of pH(i) recovery to much the same extent as removal of external Na. Its effect was not additive to that of removal of external Na.7. Internal Na ion concentration ([Na(+)](i)), measured using Na(+)-sensitive micro-electrodes, fell on application of (NH(4))(2)SO(4) and increased on its removal. The increase transiently raised [Na(+)](i) above the level recorded before (NH(4))(2)SO(4) application. This overshoot of [Na(+)](i) was almost completely inhibited by amiloride. This is consistent with the involvement of Na(+)-H(+) exchange in the pH(i) regulating system.8. Removal of external CO(2) or application of SITS (10(-4)M) caused some slowing of the rate of pH(i) recovery following acidification by removal of (NH(4))(2)SO(4). The effect of SITS was additive to that of Na-free Ringer or amiloride. These results suggest that Cl(-)-HCO(3) (-) exchange is also involved in the pH(i) regulating system and that it is a separate mechanism. Under the conditions used, Cl(-)-HCO(3) (-) exchange formed about 20% of the pH(i) regulating system.9. Decreasing the temperature from 37 to 28 degrees C not only caused an increase in pH(i), but also considerably slowed the rate of pH(i) recovery following acidification. We have calculated a Q(10) for Na(+)-H(+) exchange of 1.4 and for Cl(-)-HCO(3) (-) exchange, 6.9.10. We conclude that the pH(i) regulating system is comprised of two separate ionic exchange mechanisms. The major mechanism is Na(+)-H(+) exchange, which is probably driven by the transmembrane Na gradient. The other mechanism is Cl(-)-HCO(3) (-) exchange, which probably requires metabolic energy."

      "Change in the classic gynecologic surgery: review of 3,300 pelviscopies in 1971-1976. An endoscopic microsurgical technique has been developed on the basis of the development of a new technique for hemostasis (endocoagulation), which needs neither ligation nor high-frequency current, and a specific pelviscopic instrument setup for surgical therapeutic pelviscopy has been created. This new endoscopic technique, i.e., the microlaparotomy via pelviscopy, opens new methods for pelvic surgery, in particular for patients with infertility. Our data show that in 79% of tubal occlusions, patency can be achieved by pelviscopic surgery. In addition, lysis of intestinal adhesions, tubal sterilizations, endometriosis-coagulation, ovarian cyst resection, subserous myomectomy, and total oophorectomy can be performed with this newly devised procedure. Our data show that in our series of 3,300 pelviscopies, the complication rate was 1.1%, and only 0.1% necessitated laparotomy. In 55%, pelviscopy performed after previous laparotomies added very little risk. In 61%, destructive heat was utilized for hemostasis.

No impairment of intellectual development was observed when compared IQ before the operation and at the time of long term follow-up in serial study, but electroencephalographic assessment indicated that postoperative abnormalities might occur more frequently than previously suspected.

Twenty-one studies in which care given by nurse practitioners or physician's assistants was directly compared with that given by physicians are analyzed.

      "Physician receptivity to nurse practitioners: a study of the correlates of the delegation of clinical responsibility. A survey to measure physician receptivity to nurse practitioners was conducted in North Carolina in 1973. All North Carolina physicians were asked to rate a list of 35 clinical tasks of varying levels of difficulty and responsibility according to their willingness to delegate these tasks to nurse practitioners. Using eight items from this list that were good discriminants of physician attitudes towards delegating responsibility, task delegation scores were correlated with physician characteristics and their responses to questions about recruitment, training, reimbursement, and willingness to hire nurse practitioners. Thirty-four per cent of the respondents would hire a nurse practitioner, whereas 52% approved of the concept but would not hire one. Physicians who had previously worked with a nurse practitioner were more willing to hire one and had a higher task delegation score. Sixty-eight per cent of respondents would share their load with nurse practitioners in their offices, while 6% would have them work in satellite clinics away from the physicians' offices. Most physicians wanted their own nurse trained as a nurse practitioner in a program that combined a didactic course at a medical center with on-the-job training. The authors conclude that there is a potential demand for nurse practitioners in North Carolina and that the training program must prepare the nurse practitioners for the tasks physicians are willing to delegate to them."

This article reviews the evidence that neuroleptics may increase the risk of breast cancer via their effects on prolactin secretion. All available neuroleptics, including reserpine, raise serum prolactin levels. Elevated serum prolactin level increases the incidence of spontaneously occurring mammary tumors in mice, and increases the growth of established carcinogen-induced mammary tumors in rats. Caution is necessary in extrapolating this relationship to human mammary tumors because human and rodent tumors differ in some important characteristics, including hormone responsiveness. Serum prolactin levels in women with, or at risk for, breast cancer have generally been normal, and only a minority of human mammary tumors respond to changes in serum prolactin levels. Epidemiologic studies have failed to demonstrate an increased risk of breast cancer associated with the use of neuroleptics or reserpine. Thus, although some human mammary tumors are prolactin dependent, the available evidence does not demonstrate an increased risk of breast cancer in women receiving neuroleptics. We conclude that (1) additional epidemiologic studies of the incidence of mammary tumors in women treated with neuroleptics are desirable; (2) it is premature to mandate warning patients of an unknown and undemonstrated increase in the risk of developing breast cancer associated with neuroleptic treatment; (3) detection of existing mammary tumors by breast examination prior to administration of neuroleptics is desirable; and (4) development of antipsychotic drugs that do not increase serum prolactin level may be indicated.",
      "[Diagnosis of breast cancer by contact thermography (author's transl)]. Epidemiological studies performed in cooperation with the Austrian National Institute for Statistic show an increase of breast cancer in the age-group of women older than 50 years. Especially in this age-group screening for breast cancer is very important and successful. Mammography in this age-group is the most useful and accurate method. In the group of women aged less than 50 years and particularly less than 45 years the use of mammography for screening is limited because of its risks for the induction of breast cancer in young women. Therefore the combination of clinical examination and contact-thermography is a very promising alternative for the detection of breast cancer. In 133 cases of histologically proved breast cancer the high accuracy of this combination of clinical examination and contact-thermography in comparison with mammography is shown. Based on this good results a recommendation for a detection-scheme for breast cancer with a reduction of radiation exposure in young women by the use of contact-thermography is presented and discussed.",
      "A study of cancer of the breast with special reference to its causation and prevention. Breast feeding, lactational histories, parity, age at marriage, and socio-economic status were compared in 24 patients with carcinoma of breast, 24 healthy controls, and 48 patients suffering from other diseases. They were matched for age, social class and work or trade of the husbands. Breast cancer patients married later, had shorter lactational histories and had fewer children as compared with controls. Studies in six healthy mothers showed that milk became more alkaline on stasis in the breast. This study confirms the view that breast feeding protects against breast cancer. It suggests that one carcinogenic factor may be an alkaline milieu produced by the statis of milk in the breasts. An alkaline milieu surrounding epithelial surfaces produces cell proliferation and a marked increase in mitotic activity which may eventually lead to metaplasia and neoplasia."

Reasonable correlation was found between pH values and film density in two of the three experiments but little or no correlation was found in the third experiment and on a day-to-day basis.

      "Sarcotubular anomalous rectification of frog sartorius muscle. The membrane site responsible for anomalous rectification was determined in frog sartorius muscle fibers. The total current-voltage relation of glycerol-treated fibers which represents mainly the properties of the sarcolemma was linear for membrane potentials between about -90 and -50 mV. Thus moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification in intact fibers represents a property of the sarcotubular system. The absence of slow hyperpolarization in glycerol-treated fibers was caused by the abolition of early conductance increase, and the sarcotubular system is responsible for the inward rectifier. Picrotoxin selectively inhibited both moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification and hyperpolarization-induced early conductance increase. This suggests that the same component in the sarcotubular system is responsible for these conductance changes. The inhibition with picrotoxin of moderate depolarization-induced anomalous rectification suggests the possibility that it is caused by an electrogenic effect rather than a decrease in K conductance. A sarcolemmal hyperpolarization-activated slow conductance increase was revealed.",

The study of 16 newborn of birthweight less than or equal to 2,200 g characterized by a common point: the presence of PLACENTA PRAEVIA IN THE MOTHER, enabled us to come to grips with the severe respiratory distress that these newborn can have. From the clinical standpoint: there is always early respiratory distress. From the radiological standpoint: by far the most dominant pathology was interstitial edema, giving rise to a WET LUNG. From the biochemical standpoint: the blood gases were characterized in a certain number of cases by hypoxemia which was refractory to the usual forms of treatment. From the mechanical standpoint: measurements carried out in 4 patients confirmed the extraordinary fall in these patients' compliance. The clinical, radiological, blood gas and mechanical analysis enabled one to differenciate 2 main types of indications for artificial ventilation: -- acute hypoxemia, -- the idea of an increased need for oxygen. In these 2 types of indications for artificial ventilation, it was apparent that the treatment of choice is constant positive pressure which may or may not be combined with intermittent positive pressure. With this treatment technique, none of the patients progressed to massive atelectasis. It can be said that with the advent of techniques of ventilation by high pressure combining IPP with CPP, one has definitively eliminated from this pathological picture, the principal cause of death: --anoxia due to massive alveolar collapse.",

The lipoprotein-lipase activity (LPLA) in the abdominal, subcutaneous, adipose tissue was studied in a random sample (n = 69) of 60-year-old men. A new method for the quantification of LPLA was applied. The mean value was 67 mU/g when expressed per gram (wet weight) of adipose tissue. Several subjects within the lower part of the range of adipose-tissue LPLA values had low concentrations of serum-triglycerides (S-TG). There was no correlation between the LPLA and S-TG concentrations in the fasting state. Among the 69 subjects, four had newly detected diabetes mellitus and had significantly lower LPLA in the adipose tissue than the control group. The fat-cell size and the LPLA per gram of adipose tissue were not correlated. Thus, obesity without diabetes mellitus does not imply a low LPLA concentration in adipose tissue. The variation of the concentration of adipose-tissue LPLA in the fasting state in this population was explained only to a minor extent by the variation of S-insulin and blood-glucose parameters, when analysed statistically by a stepwise multiple-regression technique.",
      "Does hyperinsulinemia in ob/ob mice cause an insulin-stimulated adipose tissue? After a 1-h preincubation to remove endogenous insulin, adipose tissue of obese mice (C57BL/L4 ob/ob) had a lower rate of glucose metabolism than tissue which was not preincubated. In contrast, preincubation did not change the metabolism of adipose tissue from lean mice (C57B1/6J +/+). The preincubation effect was abolished in obese mice which had had their serum insulin levels lowered toward normal by streptozotocin treatment. Injection of anti-insulin serum to obese mice caused adipose tissue removed 15 min after the injection to display a rate of glucose metabolsim lower than that of tissue removed before the injection. No such effect was seen in lean mice. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia in the obese mice causes a chronic state of insulin stimulation of their adipose tissue, possibly contributing to their high rates of lipogenesis and their obesity. Several lipogenic enzymes were measured in adipose tissue of both lean and obese mice, and no single enzymatic abnormality was detected which might explain the hyperlipogenesis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase were both insulin-sensitive enzymes in lean and obese mice.",

Feeding protected tallow or maize oil but not protected sunflower seed oil plus soybean oil resulted in reduced rates of fatty acid biosynthesis in both perirenal and subcutaneous adipose tissue slices and CO2 formation in perirenal adipose tissue. Feeding the fat-supplemented diets had no effect on the rate of glyceride glycerol formation. The fat-supplemented diets also resulted in reduced activities of various enzymes, thought to be involved in lipogenesis, measured in 105,000 x g supernatant fractions from adipose tissue homogenates. The results suggested that ovine adipose tissue lipogenesis is sensitive to both the amount and the nature of dietary fat."

During a period of 30 months 216 drill biopsies of palpable breast lesions were carried out. By using this method sufficient tissue material for a histological examination could be acquired in all cases. Out of 106 cases, in which the histological results could exactly be proved by following excision biopsy or mastectomy, 87% were correctly diagnosed by drill biopsy. The reason for failure in all of the 14 false drill biopsy diagnoses was due to sampling error. Comparing the diagnostic results of the first 15 month after establishing the method, with the second half of the investigation period, a considerable improvement from 80% to 94% of correct diagnoses could be established. This improvement was based on increasing experience and routine. By means of drill biopsy, cosmetically and diagnostically disturbing scar formation could be avoided.

      "A study of cancer of the breast with special reference to its causation and prevention. Breast feeding, lactational histories, parity, age at marriage, and socio-economic status were compared in 24 patients with carcinoma of breast, 24 healthy controls, and 48 patients suffering from other diseases. They were matched for age, social class and work or trade of the husbands. Breast cancer patients married later, had shorter lactational histories and had fewer children as compared with controls. Studies in six healthy mothers showed that milk became more alkaline on stasis in the breast. This study confirms the view that breast feeding protects against breast cancer. It suggests that one carcinogenic factor may be an alkaline milieu produced by the statis of milk in the breasts. An alkaline milieu surrounding epithelial surfaces produces cell proliferation and a marked increase in mitotic activity which may eventually lead to metaplasia and neoplasia."

      "Muscle metabolism during rest and exercise: influence on the oxygen transport system of blood in normal and diabetic subjects. The oxygen dissociation curve shifted less to the right in venous blood draining from muscle in eight insulin-deficient diabetics working at a constant submaximal workload than in seven normal controls (28.7 mm. Hg vs. 30.8 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). This diminution of the in-vivo Bohr effect at the muscle tissue level during exercise in diabetics was due to a significantly smaller decrease of venous blood pH (down to 7.33 vs. 7.27 in normals; P less than 0.05), probably a consequence of an latered muscle metabolism in insulin deficiency. Although no glucose was taken up, even during exercise, and less lactate was produced by insulin-deficient muscle (P less than 0.05), the differences in venous blood pH appeared to be brought about mainly by a different CO2 production of the exercising muscle in the two groups. The response of Krebs cycle activity to exercise in insulin-deficient muscle might have been inadequate, as suggested by the increased 3-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio in the venous blood observed in the normal controls but not in the diabetics. Furthermore, proportionally less of the arterial ketone body concentration was utilized by the working muscle in the insulin-deficient diabetics. Changes in erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate did not contribute to the differences in the in-vivo Bohr effect."

A hemodynamic study by means of ultrasonic Doppler flowmetry. Blood flow in the vertebral artery and the upper extremity was studied in five cases of Takayasu's arteritis with subclavian steal by use of ultrasonic Doppler flowmetry and finger plethysmography. The diagnosis of subclavian steal was made by observation of flow reversal in the vertebral artery on the subclavian steal side during grip exercise and, in addition, the vertebral flow change with brachial artery occlusion. The blood flow increase of both internal cartotid and non-affected (non-subclavian steal side) vertebral arteries during a common carotid compression was almost normal in patients with Takayasu's arteritis in this study. During carotid compression on the side of the subclavian steal, ipsilateral vertebral blood flow greatly decreased, and the amplitude the ipsilateral finger plethysmogram decreased slightly or moderately. It is suggested that there are significantly important factors in suppressing sumptoms of vertebrobasilar ischemia in these patients with Takayasu's arteritis with subclavian steal. These factors are believed to be (1) good function of the circle of Willis, (2) good blood supply to the brain stem, and (3) collateral circulation to the distal subclavian artery not via the vertebral artery.",
      "Comparison of arm versus leg work in induction of acute episodes of asthma. The severity of exercise-induced asthma varies with the type of exercise performed. To determine whether such variation could be attributed to the use of different muscle groups, we exercised arms separately from legs using a bicycle ergometer. First, arms were exercised to exhaustion, then legs were exercised at the same load for the same duration. Arm work resulted in greater ventilation, heart rate, hydrogen ion concentration, and airway obstruction than did leg work. Later, legs were exercised to exhaustion using a load more than twice that of the arm work. Both the exhausting leg work and exhausting arm work resulted in significant bronchospasm and acidosis, whereas the nonexhausting leg work did not. These data suggest that, in arm and/or leg exercise, the relationship of work load to muscle mass is a determinant of airway obstruction.",

There was no breakthrough of autoregulation, previously seen in the untreated animal. It is suggested, therefore, that the previously observed breakthrough of autoregulation is a beta adrenergic-mediated phenomenon."

Eight (26 per cent) died after the operation. Since 1969, the mortality rate has been reduced to 14 per cent (3 of 22 patients) even though the incidence of major associated cardiac lesions has remained essentially constant (56 per cent from 1966 through 1969, 64 per cent from 1970 through March, 1975). This suggests that the higher survival rate has resulted from improved surgical techniques and postoperative care. The mortality rate in the infants operated upon during the second and third months of life was twice as high as that in those operated upon before the age of 1 month. Eight patients with Type A interrupted aortic arch were operated upon and 5 survived. Five patients with Type B aortic arch were operated upon and 3 survived."

      "Inhibition of growth and guanylate cyclase activity of an undifferentiated prostate adenocarcinoma by an extract of the balsam pear (Momordica charantia abbreviata). We have recently described the presence of a guanylate cyclase [GTP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.2] inhibitor (GCI) in an aqueous extract of the balsam pear (Momordica charantia abbreviata). Because the guanylate cyclase-cyclic GMP system is though to be involved in cell growth, DNA and RNA synthesis, and possible malignant transformation, we examined the effect of the aqueous extract containing GCI on an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma of the rat prostate and concanavalin-A-stimulated [3H]thymidine incorporation into cultured splenic lymphocytes, a process thought to be mediated by cyclic GMP. The results demonstrate that the extract of the balsam pear blocks both the growth of the rat prostatic adencarcinoma in vitro and [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. DNA histograms from flow cytometry indicated that the extract containing GCI inhibited in the G2 + M phase of the cell cycle, a presumed locus of cyclic GMP effects. In addition, guanylate cyclase activity was significantly greater in the tumor than normal prostate tissue and was decreased by the extract containing GCI. Cyclic GMP levels in the tumor in culture wer also decreased by addition of the extract. It remains to be determined whether or not the anti-tumor agent and GCI are the same substance.",

Eight patients had documented episodes of aspiration (drop on esophagela pH, followed by acid taste in mouth and onset of cough or wheezing spell) during the monitoring period. Nine patients were considered to be potential aspirators because they presented oral acid regurgitation without development of pulmonary symptoms. In five patients a primary respiratory disorder (PRD) induced gastroesophageal reflux. The remaining 78 patients had abnormal reflux without aspiartion or regurgitation. Aspirators had a 75% incidence of esophageal motor abnormality on manometry, and the clearance of refluxed acid was significantly delayed in the supine position. A history of heartburn and endoscopic evidence of esophagitis were present in only half of the patients who were documented aspirators. Potential aspirators were spared from aspiration by rapid esophageal clearance of refluxed acid unaffected by changes in body position. Patients with a PRD had higher distal esophageal segment (DES) pressure and normal esophageal motility with minimal esophagitis. Nonaspirators significantly improved their clearance while in the supine position, emphasizing the protective effect of esophageal peristalsis against aspiration. An antireflux procedure in five aspirators raised the DES pressure significantly and returned the reflux status to normal by 24-hour pH-monitoring standards. The incidence of aspiration appears to be less than that suspected by history and is due to a motor disorder that interferes with the ability of the esophagus to clear reflex acid. Abnormal pulmonary symptoms can induce or result from gastroesophageal reflux and, when the latter occurs, an antireflex procedure stops both reflux and aspiration.",
      "Surgery for short esophagus with stricture: an experimental and clinical manometric study. The surgical management of short esophagus with stricture has been simplified in recent years by the introduction of an esophageal lengthening procedure (Collis gastroplasty) combined with antireflux maneuvers, such as the Belsey and Nissen operations. This report compares the experimental and clinical manometric findings after these procedures. After myectomy of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) in the cat, three experimental groups were developed including Collis gastroplasty, Collis-Belsey and Collis-Nissen. formation of a gastric tube did not provide protection against reflux while the Collis-Nissen procedure was more effective than the Collis-Belsey in raising pressures at the high pressure zone (HPZ) (26.0 +/- 3.5 cm H2O vs 15.0 +/- 2.7) and in preventing reflux (pH 6.3 +/- 0.5 vs 2.9 +/- 0.04). Of 20 patients with short esophagus and stricture, 11 underwent a Collis-Belsey procedure and nine a Collis-Nissen procedure. The latter procedure resulted in an HPZ of greater amplitude and length than the Collis-Belsey (18.7 +/- 2.3 mm Hg vs 11.6 +/- 1.7 and 3.9 +/- 0.4 cm vs 2.4 +/- 0.2). It also proved to be a more effective antireflux procedure, for no patient so treated had a positive pH reflux test after operation whereas after the Collis-Belsey procedure all but one patient had a positive pH reflux test. Short-term clinical results also support the superiority of the Collis-Nissen operation."

The two methods were also compared in the determination of lipase activity of human leucocytes in vitro. The results show that there is a good statistical correlation of lipase turbidimetrically determined at pH 9.15 and amylase in serum of normal individuals and in serum of patients with pancreatic diseases. There is no correlation between amylase and chromatographically determined lipase. The other types of lipase activity determined, i.e. turbidimetrically assayed at pH 5.5 and chromatographically assayed both at pH 5.5 and at pH 9.15, might be related to a different non-pancreatic enzymatic activity which is likely to lack diagnostic value.

The difference in net flux of HCO3- across the duct before and after exposure to the test agent reflected damage to the barrier. The barrier was damaged by infected bile, aspirin (pH 2.3), hydrochloric acid (pH 2.3), ethanol (5 to 10 per cent), and secondary bile acids. It was not damged by sterile bile, aspirin (pH 6.5), and primary bile acids. These data indicate that the barrier to back diffusion in the pancreatic duct has unique properties, different in some respects from the properties of the gastric mucosal barrier. Furthermore, the barrier is vulnerable to some agents thought possibly to have a role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer."

A 72% prediction rate for middle ear pathogens was obtained by examining the nasopharyngeal cultures after the strict observance of two essential prerequisites: (1) the nasopharyngeal culture was immediately plated on appropriate solid agar and (2) a semiquantitative method for bacterial enumeration was employed in the reading of the nasopharyngeal culture plates. The technique was most valuable where 2+ (greater than 25% up to 50% of total number of colonies was a single pathogen) or greater of a single pathogen was recovered from the nasopharynx. In only one instance, the semiquantitative nasopharyngeal culture incorrectly predicted the middle ear pathogen if one was recovered. Quantitative nasopharyngeal cultures were particularly useful in predicting the presence of ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae and group A streptococci as causative agents in otitis media.",

For the past 20 years, obligatory lymphadenectomy has been performed with the Wertheim's operation for carcinoma of the cervix at the First University Women's Clinic in Vienna. Formerly, selective lymphadenectomy was performed with the radical operation, with only nodes suspected of metastasis being removed. The theoretical advantages and disadvantages of each system are discussed, and several previous reports are analyzed and criticized. Our experience at the First University Women's Clinic shows that rates of mortality from recurrence were higher for a group of patients who underwent selective lymphadenectomy from 1946 to 1949 than for two more recent series who were treated with obligatory lymphadenectomy. Thus, the effectiveness of performing the latter procedure with the Wertheim's operation to reduce mortality from recurrence is confirmed.",

Although preliminary studies with 1 mCi had not shown any iodine uptake by the brain metastasis, this lesion showed intense concentration at the time of the larger therapeutic dose. Four days later, acute hemorrhage of the tumor occurred, requiring surgical removal. Although 131I therapy would seem an unlikely cause of acute necrosis and hemorrhage in these lesions, the association of therapeutic radioiodine and hemorrhage is interesting. Since recent reports suggest that brain metastasis may be somewhat more common than previously suspected, we suggest that brain imaging be included in the workup prior to radioiodine therapy of patients with advanced metastatic disease or neurologic symptoms."

No factors were strongly linked to lung cancer in men, but, in women, urban residence and miang chewing were associated with lung cancer. Analysis of smoke from the two main types of cigars smoked in the region showed that both had high tar content, but there were marked differences in pH. Smoking cigars with alkaline smoke and high tar had an increased risk for laryngeal cancer in males, whereas other cigars with acid smoke and high tar together with manufactured cigarettes had increased risks for lung cancer.

Cultured fibroblasts from each specimen were also examined with the SEM. A biochemical profile of each tissue specimen was constructed, characterizing the collagen component of the specimen by sequential molecular sieve and ion exchange chromatography to determine a) the degree of intermolecular crosslinking, b) amino acid analysis, and c) levels of lysyl oxidase activity. Results indicate that collagen fibers and fiber bundles display a decreasing level of organization as the clinical degree of scar abnormality increases, and this structural gradient correlates with the gradient of intermolecular crosslinking in the same tissue--normal skin and mature scar being highly crosslinked, hypertrophic and keloid successively less so. Surprisingly, the level of the crosslinking enzyme lysyl oxidase is normal or elevated in hypertrophic scar and keloid despite the relative lack of crosslinking.

      "Prediction of wound sepsis following gastric operations. Gastric aspirates were obtained from 12 healthy volunteers, 49 patients with duodenal ulcer, 14 with gastric ulcer and 35 with gastric carcinoma. The mean total viable bacterial counts in these groups were as follows: volunteers 0, duodenal ulcer 3.8 X 10(1), gastric ulcer 6.95 X 10(4), carcinoma 1.9 X 10(7) organisms/ml. The incidence of wound sepsis in patients without antibiotic cover was; duodenal ulcer 17 per cent, gastric ulcer 38 per cent, carcinoma 56 per cent. Regardless of the underlying pathology, patients with counts greater than 5 X 10(6) organisms/ml in the gastric aspirate had a 93 per cent incidence of wound sepsis, compared with 16 per cent in patients with counts of less than 5 X 10(6) organisms/ml (P less than 0.001). In the group with high counts all except one of the wound infections were caused by organisms present in the stomach at the time of operation. There was a good correlation in the bacteriology of apirates obtained during preoperative endoscopy compared with operative nasogastric samples (n = 31) both for viable counts (r = 0.93) and for the counts of individual organisms. Therefore, preoperative endoscopy can be used to identify patients who are at risk of developing wound sepsis after gastric surgery.",

The discovery of interferon in 1957 by Drs. Isaacs and Lindenmann led to major revisions in the concepts of man's defenses against viral infections. There are at least two types of interferon. Along with their antiviral properties, they have recently been shown to exert a suppressive effect on the humoral and cellular immune response; they affect both B and T lymphocytes. A variety of substances, including virus, polyribonucleotides, and mitogens for T lymphocytes, are good interferon inducers. T lymphocytes seem to be necessary for these inducers to exert their immunosuppressive effects. The immunosuppressive effects of interferon inducers suggests that interferons may be mediators of suppressor T lymphocyte effects. In the virus system, interferon does not exert its antiviral effects by direct action on the virus, but rather derepresses a cell gene that results in the production of an antiviral protein. This antiviral protein is probably the mediator of inhibition of virus replication. This is a complex sequence of events that results in the interaction of interferon with the cell membrane and the resulting production of the antiviral state in the cell. This review will examine the various steps of this involved process.",
      "[Polyarteritis nodosa: general aspects and occurrence in domestic animals, particularly in association with nosematosis in blue foxex (author's transl)]. A survey of polyarteritis nodosa in domestic animals is presented, including a description of the patho-morphological lesions and a discussion on the causal factors. This vascular disease occurs in domestic animals in association with both viral infections (infectious plasmacytosis in mink), bacterial infections (erysipelas in swine), and protozoan infections (nosematosis in blue foxes). The conclusion is drawn that the observations in domestic animals support the view that immunological disturbances are involved as pathogenetic mechanisms. Nosematosis is dealt with in more detail; the infecting agent (fig. 1), Nosema cuniculi (Encephalitozoon cuniculi), is a widespread mamalian parasite, which causes cerebral and renal lesions in blue foxes of the same type as in animals of other species. In addition, the vascular system throughout the body is affected, resulting in patho-morphological alterations corresponding to classical polyarteritis nodosa (Fig. 2). In the early stages of involvement, masses of parasitic organisms are regularly found within the walls of affected arteries (Fig. 3). This disease is frequently lethal, and always accompanied by elevated values of gamma globulins. Both the hypergammaglobulinemia and the tissue lesions, seem at times, at least in part, to be reversible.",

      "Phosphofructokinase. III. Correlation of the regulatory kinetic and molecular properties of the rabbit muscle enzyme. It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation.",
      "Dependence of phrenic motoneurone output on the oscillatory component of arterial blood gas composition. 1. The hypothesis that respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition influence ventilation has been examined. 2. Phrenic motoneurone output recorded in the C5 root of the left phrenic nerve and the respiratory oscillations of arterial pH in the right common carotid artery were measured in vagotomized anaesthetized dogs which had been paralysed and artificially ventilated. 3. The effect of a change in tidal volume for one or two breaths on phrenic motoneurone output was measured with the inspiratory pump set at a constant frequency similar to, and in phase with, the animal's own respiratory frequency. A reduction of tidal volume to zero or an increase by 30% led to a corresponding change of mean carotid artery pH level. The changes of carotid artery pH resulted in a change of phrenic motoneurone output, predominantly of expiratory time (Te) but to a lesser extent of inspiratory time (T1) and also peak amplitude of 'integrated' phrenic motoneurone output (Phr). Denervation of the carotid bifurcation blocked this response. 4. The onset of movement of the inspiratory pump was triggered by the onset of phrenic motoneurone output. When a time delay was interposed between them, the phase relationship between respiratory oscillations of arterial pH and phrenic motoneurone output altered. The dominant effect was to alter Te; smaller and less consistent changes of Phr and T1 were observed. 5. When the inspiratory pump was maintained at a constant frequency but independent of and slightly different from the animal's own respiratory frequency (as judged by phrenic motoneurone output), the phase relationship between phrenic motoneurone output and the respiratory oscillations of pH changed breath by breath over a sequence of 100-200 breaths, without change of the mean level of arterial blood gas composition. Te varied by up to 30% about its mean value depending on the phase relationship. Ti and Phr were also dependent on the phase relationship but varied to a lesser extent. The changes were comparable to the results obtained in paragraph 4. 6. It was concluded that phrenic motoneurone output is dependent in part on its relationship to the respiratory oscillations of arterial blood gas composition. 7. Information concerning a transient ventilatory disturbance is stored in the arterial blood in the form of an altered pattern of the respiratory oscillations of blood gas composition; this in turn can change breathing by an effect on the carotid bodies."

Lesions were noted in 7.0 and 4.4% of mandible pairs collected from the Western Arctic caribou herd of northwestern Alaska in 1959-61 and 1975-77, respectively. The prevalence of mandibular lesions in the 1959-61 collection is believed to be the highest reported in wild caribou herds of North America. The frequency of occurrence of mandibular lesions was highest in caribou 7 years of age and older, and there was a higher prevalence in adult males than in adult females.

Value and limitations studied in a series of 100 patients]. Repeated continuous ambulatory electrocardiography by Holter monitoring was performed after early mobilisation post-myocardial infarction in 100 patients, without ventricular extrasystoles on classical ECG. Frequent ventricular arrhythmias were recorded in 58 p. 100 cases, unrelated to the localisation of the infarct. The observation of ventricular arrhythmias in the Coronary Care Unit (CCU) was not related to the occurrence of VEs during Holter monitoring. On the other hand, VEs were less frequent (38 p. 100 compared to 68 p. 100) in patients taking amiodarone or betablockers on transfer from the CCU. The reduced activity of patients during Holter monitoring minimises the frequency of arrhythmias, and 10 p. 100 patients were observed to have VEs only after exercise tolerance testing. These VEs seem to be a bad prognostic factor; the 9 patients who died in this series all presented VEs on ambulatory monitoring (7) or during exercise tolerance testing (2). However the number of patients with triple vessel disease was greater in the group with VEs on ambulatory monitoring (57 p. 100 compared with 13 p. 100). It is difficult to assess the precise role of the VEs amongst the other risk factors of sudden death.

      "Derangements of myocardial metabolism preceding onset of ventricular fibrilliation after coronary occlusion. To determine alterations in myocardial metabolism and and hemodynamics that occur within the first 30 minutes after coronary arterial occlusion, before the onset of ventricular fibrillation, measurements were compared in two series of dogs. Series A, 90 dogs that did not manifest ventricular fibrillation after coronary occlusion, were considered a control group. Series B consisted of 28 dogs that had ventricular fibrillation within 30 minutes after occlusion. All had similar comprehensive measurements completed preceding the onset of ventricular fibrillation. The animals in series B (subseuqnt fibrillation) had significantly higher heart rates before and after coronary occlusion. In this series cardiac metabolism of the occluded segment judged by transmyocardial lactate extraction, potassium balance, sodium/potassium ratio and blood pH because grossly more abnormal after coronary occlusion than in series A. In 5 animals whose measurements were obtained within 5 minutes of the onset of ventricular fibrillation, a sudden massive lactate production, potassium loss and increased acidosis of the occluded portion supervened minutes before the onset of the fatal arrhythmia. Animals with ventricular fibrillation had higher intracoronary S-T segment elevation that persisted until the onset of ventricular fibrillation. Measurements of abnormal hemodynamic function (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, peak systolic pressure and first derivative of left ventricular pressure [DP/dt]) were not associated with an increased incidence of ventricular fibrillation. The study indicates that animals that manifest ventricular fibrillation within 30 minutes after coronary occlusion have higher preocclusion heart rates, a more severe metabolic disorder of the coronary occluded segment and more persistent intracoronary S-T segment elevation compared with animals that do not manifest ventricular fibrillation.",
      "Efficacy of cardioselective beta adrenergic blockade with intravenously administered tolamolol in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. The efficacy of tolamolol, a cardioselective beta adrenergic blocking agent, was evaluated in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias in 27 patients. Nineteen patients had supraventricular arrhythmias and eight had ventricular arrhythmias. Evaluation was by doulbe-blind randomized trial in 23 patients. Tolamolol was effective in reducing ventricular rate in 17 (85 percent) of 19 patients with supraventricular arrhythmias and resulted in conversion to sinus rhythm in 2 of the 17. The mean ventricular rate in 17 patients decreased from 135 to 102/min 10 minutes after initiation of administration of tolamolol and gradually decreased further to 93/min after 60 minutes. Reduction in ventricular rate was sustained for 2 hours of monitoring undergone by all patients and for 4 and 6 hours monitoring in two subgroups. Among the eight patients with ventricular ectopic beats, tolamolol reduced their frequency in four patients and had no effect in four. Six patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and experienced no adverse clinical effects on respiratory function in association with administration to tolamolol. Untoward effects occurred in 10 patients, including hypotension in 3, 1 of whom required vasopressor therapy. Other side effects were sedation, nausea, dyspnea and warmth in the chest, all of which were mild and transient, requiring no treatment. Cardioselective beta adrenergic blockade with tolamolol was highly effective in controlling ventricular rate in supraventricular arrhythmias and reduced the frequency of ventricular ectopic beats in half of the small group of patients with this arrhythmia. It is particularly applicable in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease in whom cardiac beta adrenergic blockade is indicated. Hypotension is an important potential side effect."

A combined informant questionnaire and interview survey of self-injurious behavior (SIB) at a large state facility for the retarded was conducted independently three times over a 3-year period. Prevalence consistently was about 10% of the population. SIB cases tended to be younger and institutionalized longer than the rest of the population. Severe cases had a longer history of chronic SIB. SIB cases had more seizure disorders, severe language handicaps, visual impairments, and severe or profound retardation than the rest of the population. They appeared to fulfill most of the Rutter (1966) criteria for autism. But unlike the severely autistic, there was little relation of sex to incidence of SIB. Over 90% of SIB cases changed status over 3 years, suggesting that SIB was amenable to behavior modification in most cases (94%). Psychotropic behavior control medications helped in some intervention programs (32%). SIB remitted spontaneously in 21% of SIB cases where there had been no behavioral or drug intervention.",
      "Pathology of acute graft-versus-host disease in the dog. An autopsy study of ninety-five dogs. The morphology of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in canine radiation chimeras was studied by examination of autopsy tissue from 95 dogs including: 1) 13 healthy, untreated dogs; 2) 9 dogs given 1200 R total body irradiation and no marrow infusion; 3) 17 dogs given 1200 R and autologous marrow infusion; 4) 25 dogs given 1200 R and hemopoietic cells from dog-leukocyte-antigen (DLA)--identical littermates; and 5) 31 dogs given 1200 R and nonidentical DLA hemopoietic cells. Some of the dogs in Groups 3--5 received a postgrafting methotrexate (MTX) regimen of 0.25--0.5 mg/kg body weight on Days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and once weekly until Day 102. Prominent lesions were found in the small and large intestines, skin, and liver of dogs with allogeneic grafts. Skin lesions consisted of lymphocytic infiltrates of epidermis with necrosis of basal epidermal cells progressing to denudation. Gut lesions consisted of mucosal destruction progressing from crypt abscess formation to denudation. Liver lesions consisted of portal triaditis, plasmacytic and lymphocytic infiltrates, necorsis and atypia of small bile ducts, and scattered individual hepatocyte necrosis. These lesions were differentiated from changes caused by irradiation and MTX and were deemed characteristic of GVHD. The overall severity of GVHD lesions was less in the identical DLA group than in the nonidentical DLA group, and also less in dogs treated with MTX than in those not given MTX. The degree of lymphoid depletion in the lymph nodes, spleen, and intestinal lymphoid tissue was very similar in dogs with autologous and allogeneic grafts at comparable survival times. No specific evidence of pancreatic or renal involvement in GVHD was discovered."

The unusually high relative frequency of cancer in the laryngeal region in males (18% of all histologically diagnosed cancers) and a sex ratio of unity for lung cancer in Northern Thailand were further explored in a hospital-based case-control study in Chiang Mai. This compared patients having cancers of the oral cavity (including oropharynx), larynx, hypopharynx and lung, with controls in relation to smoking and chewing habits. Statistical analysis indicated that chewing betel is strongly associated with the occurrence of oral cancer in both sexes, and with cancer of the laryngeal region in males. No factors were strongly linked to lung cancer in men, but, in women, urban residence and miang chewing were associated with lung cancer. Analysis of smoke from the two main types of cigars smoked in the region showed that both had high tar content, but there were marked differences in pH. Smoking cigars with alkaline smoke and high tar had an increased risk for laryngeal cancer in males, whereas other cigars with acid smoke and high tar together with manufactured cigarettes had increased risks for lung cancer.

Plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and serum enzyme levels of phosphohexose isomerase (PHI), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (psi-GTP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured in 147 patients with malignancy. Levels were higher in patients (particularly with G.I., breast and lung cancers) than in normals or in patients with cancer in clinical remission. Elevations of CEA and of all three enzymes in blood were most frequent in patients with hepatic metastases. CEA elevations correlated directly with PHI levels. Seventy-eight percent of patients with metastatic G.I. cancer could be identified by CEA (greater than 5 ng/ml) alone, as well as 38% with breast cancer and 85% with lung cancer; but only 17% of other cancers could be identified by CEA alone. CEA or one or more enzymes was elevated in 64% of metastatic breast cancer patients, 92% of lung cancer and 41% of other cancers, but enzyme measurement did not increase identification of G.I. cancer over that achieved by CEA alone. These findings suggest that circulating levels of CEA, PHI, psi-GTP and LDH may reflect a direct contribution from the malignant tissue and/or liver malfunction secondary to liver replacement."

This procedure consists of standard thoracotomy and pararectal incision with an entry into the retroperitoneal space. Long prosthetic graft was anastomosed in an end-to-side fashion to bypass the coarctated aorta. The graft is placed through peripheral circumference of the left hemidiaphragm, where phrenic nerve injury is not likely to occur. This technique was successfully applied to two cases of long-segment atypical coarctation of the aorta due to Takayasu's aortitis. Retroperitoneal placement of the graft prevents fatal hemorrhage due to direct contact with the graft. Contamination with transintestinal exudate can also be avoided.

      "Neuroendocrine embryology and the APUD concept. In the Vertebrata the great majority of cells producing hormonal peptides belong to the APUD series and share its distinctive cytochemical and ultrastructural characteristics. According to the concept all members of the series are to be regarded as derivatives of neuroectoderm or of specialized (placodal) ectoderm. For most of the APUD cells this criterion is fulfilled in that their origin from neural tube, neural ridges or neural crest can be considered proven. Complete proof is not yet available for the APUD cells of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, and indeed much contrary evidence can be cited. Despite the latter, our embryological studies show: (1) that the hypothalamohypophyseal complex is wholly neuroectodermal; (2)that the chronology of neural crest dispersion is such that this tissue could be responsible for observed APUD cell contributions to the foregut; (3) that placodal ectoderm makes important contributions to pharyngeal pouch endocrine derivatives in birds and mammals; and (4) that the amphibian parathyroid gland is derived from the same layer of neural ectoderm as the hypothalamo-hypophyseal axis. Supporting immunocytochemical studies indicate that peptides belonging to the APUD series are more widely distributed than hitherto recognized and it is concluded: (1) that the whole of peptide endocrinology is neuroendocrinology; and (2) that the APUD cells, with a few cells hitherto regarded as being outside the series, form a third (Endocrine) division of the nervous system to add to the existing Somatic and Autonomic divisions."

A population of RNA fragments of average length 250 nucleotides, originating from a unique region of TMV RNA, is encapsidated by limited assembly, and sufficient sequence information is available to identify certain unusual features. The protected region does not contain highly reiterated simple repeating sequences, but may contain more complicated repeats. The length and complexity of the nucleation region may reflect adaptation to the efficient mediation of the conformational change from disk to helix of TMV protein, besides a requirement for binding to the disk, and this may be an important part of the mechanism of specificity in the nucleation of assembly.",

Regulation of L-threonine biosynthesis by the intracellular level of S-adenosylmethionine. (1) An unusual accumulation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine in Chromatium D was associated with a marked growth inhibition by L-methionine. The inhibition was overcome by L-isoleucine, L-leucine, L-phyenylalanine, L-threonine, L-valine and putrescien. Based on their effects, these compounds are classified into 3 types. (2) L-Isoleucine, L-leucine, L-phyenylalanine and L-valine (Type I) inhibited the L-methionine uptake and consequently prevented the bacterium from the unusual accumulation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine even in the presence of L-methionine in the medium. Putrescine (Type II) stimulated the consumption of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, but did not influence the L-methionine uptake. Hence, the effect of putrescine would be explained by the action to diminish the intracellular level of S-adenosyl-L-methionine. L-Threonine (Type III) neither inhibited the L-methionine uptake nor affected the content of S-adenoxyl-L-methionine due to the addition of L-methionine. (3) The specific activity of homoserine kinase (EC 2.7.1.39) was greatly lowered by the addition of L-methionine under conditions in which Chromatium D unusually accumulates S-adenoxyl-L-methionine. Homoserine dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.3) activity was inhbitied by S-adenosyl-L-methionine (50% inhibition index, 3.5 mM). These facts strongly suggest that the growth inhibition by L-methionine is associated with the L-threonine deficiency caused by the unusual accumulation of S-adenosyl-L-methionine.",
      "Ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase. II. Physical, catalytic, and regulatory properties. Some physical, catalytic, and regulatory properties of ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase (5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate: alpha-ketoisovalerate hydroxymethyltranferase) from Escherichia coli are described. This enzyme catalyzes the reversible synthesis of ketopantoate (Reaction 1), an essential precursor of pantothenic acid. (1) HC(CH3)2COCOO- + 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate f in equilibrium r HOCH2C(CH3)2COCOO- + tetrahydrofolate  It has a molecular weight by sedimentation equilibrium of 255,000, a sedimentation coefficient (S20,w) of 11 S, a partial specific volume of 0.74 ml/g, an isoelectric point of 4.4, and an absorbance, (see article), of 0.85. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate and amino acid analyses give a subunit molecular weight of 27,000 and 25,700, respectively; both procedures indicate the presence of 10 identical subunits. The NH2-terminal sequence is Met-Tyr---. The enzyme is stable and active over a broad pH range, with an optimum from 7.0 to 7.6. It requires Mg2+ for activity; Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+ are progressively less active. The enzyme is not inactivated by borohydride reduction in the presence of excess substrates, i.e. it is a Class II aldolase. Reaction 1f is partially inhibited by concentrations of formaldehyde (0.8 mM) and tetrahydrofolate (0.38 mM) below or near the Km values, apparent Km values are 0.18, 1.1 and 5.9 mM for tetrahydrofolate, alpha-ketoisovalerate, and formaldehyde, respectively. For Reaction 1r, apparent Km values are 0.16 and 0.18 mM, respectively, for ketopantoate and tetrahydrofolate, and the saturation curves for both substrates show positive cooperativity. Forward and reverse reactions occur at similar maximum velocities (Vmax approximately equal to 8 mumol of ketopantoate formed or decomposed per min per mg of enzyme at 37 degrees). Only 1-tetrahydrofolate is active in Reaction 1; d-tetrahydrofolate, folate, and methotrexate were neither active nor inhibitory. However, 1-tetrahydrofolate was effectively replaced with conjugates containing 1 to 6 additional glutamate residues; of these, tetrahydropterolpenta-, tetra-, and triglutamate were effective at lower concentrations than tetrahydrofolate itself; they were also the predominant conjugates of tetrahydrofolate present in E. coli. Alpha-Ketobutyrate, alpha-ketovalerate, and alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate replaced alpha-ketoisovalerate as substrates; pyruvate was inactive as a substrate, but like isovalerate, 3-methyl-2-butanone and D- or L-valine, inhibited Reaction 1. the transferase has regulatory properties expected of an enzyme catalyzing the first committed step in a biosynthetic pathway. Pantoate (greater than or equal to 500 muM) and coenzyme A (above 1 mM) all inhibit; the Vmax is decreased, Km is increased, and the cooperativity for substrate (ketopantoate) is enhanced. Catalytic activity of the transferase is thus regulated by the products of the reaction path of which it is one component; transferase synthesis is not repressed by growth in the presence of pantothenate.",
      "Recognition of two intracellular cobalamin binding proteins and their identification as methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthetase. The granulocyte R-type cobalamin binding protein delivers cobalamin (Cbl) exclusively to hepatocytes, and transcobalamin II delivers Cbl to various mammalian cells. Both protein-Cbl complexes enter cells by pinocytosis, and the protein moieties are rapidly degraded in lysosomes. The liberated Cbl is subsequently bound to a high-molecular-weight intracellular cobalamin binding protein (ICB). The nature of ICB-Cbl is unknown but appears important because ICB-[57Co]Cbl is missing from cultured fibroblasts of a group of patients whose cells take up CN-[57Co]Cbl normally but do not convert it to either of its coenzyme forms. We have examined supernatants of sonicated rabbit livers and have found that 65% of the total endogenous Cbl elutes from Sephadex G-150 as ICB-Cbl and that this fraction also contains the two mammalian Cbl-dependent enzymes, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (methylmalonyl-CoA CoA-carbonylmutase;EC 5.4.99.2) and methionine synthetase (tetrahydropteroylglutamate methyltransferase; 5-methyltetrahydropteroyl-L-glutamate:L-homocysteine-S-methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.13). Gradient elution from DEAE-Sephadex reveals that 90--95% of the ICB--Cbl elutes with methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and 5--10% elutes with methionine synthetase. ICB--[57Co]Cbl first appears 2 hr after the intravenous injection of CN[57Co]Cbl bound to granulocyte R-type protein. This ICB-[57Co]Cbl is associated with either methylmalonyl-CoA mutase or methionine synthetase although the latter appears to be formed at a relatively faster rate. Our studies indicate that mammalian cells contain two ICBs, that these proteins are methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthetase, and that the primary abnormality in the group of patients mentioned above lies at a step that is common to the formation of both Cbl coenzymes and that precedes the stable binding of Cbl to both methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthetase."

      "[Ulcerative rectocolitis. Somatic aspects (author's transl)]. Regional enteritis (Crohn's disease) and ulcerative rectocolitis, both \"non specific inflammatory diseases of the bowel\", might be diseases with a common etiology but with clinical features corresponding to a different tissular response to a noxious factor. Both diseases are however characterized by distinct clinical, radiological, histological peculiarities; evolution also is different, as appears from the rarity of malignant degeneration in Crohn's disease and its frequence in ulcerative colitis; a psychological support seems to be classical in ulcerative colitis but is on the contrary unusual in regional ileitis. Besides the interference of psychological factors in the outbreak of an ulcerative colitis, besides the infectious and genetic theories, the immunological theory appears as one of the most interesting and promising. In a significant percentage of cases of ulcerative colitis, anticolon antibodies are evidenced, which exhibit a crossed reaction with bacterial antigens, especially with those of Escherichia coli 014. Besides this humoral immunity a cellular immunity exists also: lymphocytes of patients with ulcerative colitis behave as a toxic agent towards colic tissue cultures; this cytotoxicity parallels the course of the disease and provides an explanation for the sometimes dramatic therapeutic effects observed after administration of immunosuppressive drugs and antilymphocytic serum. Moreover, colic antigen can block this cytotoxicity; the immunologically active portion of this antigen may be isolated and its administration in patients with ulcerative colitis may perhaps induce a specific immunosuppression and influence the evolution of the disease.",

Serotonin secretion from human platelets, stimulated either by thrombin or the calcium ionophore A23187, was found to be inhibited by anion transport blocking drugs such as 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (SITS), pyridoxal phosphate, probenecid, and suramin. These drugs have previously been shown to inhibit ATP-evoked release of epinephrine from isolated chromaffin granules by blocking chloride uptake and subsequent osmotic lysis. However, in contrast to granule release, platelet secretion was insensitive to chloride and, instead, was dependent on OH-. Platelet release was suppressed by low pH, and inhibition by the transport blocking drugs was competitive only with respect to OH-. Serotonin release from platelets was also suppressed by increasing extracellular osmotic strength, and the relationship between suppression and external osmotic strength was quantitatively similar to that observed in the case of chromaffin granules. We conclude that platelet exocytosis could occur when serotonergic granules are closely juxtaposed to the plasma membrane, thus exposing the granule anion transport site to the more alkaline medium. Secretion of serotonin could occur as a consequence of OH- transport and osmotic lysis of the granule-plasma membrane complex, analogous to the chemiosmotic mechanism of chloride-dependent epinephrine release from isolated chromaffin granules.",

      "The mediator of cellular immunity. XII. Inhibition of activated T cells by Newcastle disease virus. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) can interact in at least two ways with rat T cells. By adsorbing to circulating lymphocytes, the virus can transiently deflect the cells from lymph nodes and inflammatory exudates induced in the peritoneal cavity. T cells are affected regardless of age, state of activation, or position in the mitotic cycle. The effect is reversible and is mediated not only by infectious (I)-NDV, but also by UV-NDV which cannot achieve a complete replication cycle in eggs. But I-NDV has another lasting effect on activated T cells. It is revealed in the failure of virus-treated thoracic duct lymphocytes to transfer cellular resistance to Listeria monocytogenes, delayed-type hypersensitivity to soluble antigens of the parasite, and the permanent exclusion of labeled S-phase lymphocytes from inflammatory foci. Activated T cells are inhibited by virus multiplicites which have little if any effect upon  the proliferative potential of antigen-sensitive T cells or localization of labeled small lymphocytes in lymph nodes. The underlying mechanism has not been determined; however, there are reasons for thinking that NDV has a lethal effect upon activated T cells, because the latter are permissive for virus replication.",

Sixty-five participants (not all of them students) in the conference on iatrogenic disease replied to the questionnaire, and from the answers it was clear that not only the attitudes of those responding had in some cases been changed but in some positive action had resulted, for example, in the matter of prescribing. This analysis may provide an answer to those who criticize conferences as being a waste of time and money, because much more than could be evaluated from the responses to this survey must have affected all the participants."

Changes in free Ca(2+) within the ;ghosts' were studied by following the rate of luminescence of obelin. The possibility that the obelin might have been released from the ;ghosts' during an experiment was investigated by studying the release of inulin and pyruvate kinase from the ;ghosts'. Less than 10% of the inulin or pyruvate kinase sealed within the ;ghosts' was released under any of the experimental conditions. 3. Triton X-100 (0.1-10%, v/v) made the ;ghosts' highly permeable to Ca(2+). In the presence of 1mm-Ca(2+) and Triton, 95-100% of the obelin was utilized within 10-20s. 4.

      "The properties of mnemiopsin, a bioluminescent and light sensitive protein purified by hollow fiber techniques. A calcium activated photoprotein, termed mnemiopsin, which emits bioluminescence upon the addition of calcium ion, has been isolated from the Ctenophore, Memiopsis leidyi, and purified by hollow fiber techniques. The system is similar to aequorin, from the jellyfish Aequorea, except that mnemiopsin can be light-inactivated. Separation of mnemiopsin from the dilute and large volume animal homogenate proved difficult with conventional biochemical techniques. A continuous flow process utilizing large surface area hollow fibers for filtration, concentration, and dialysis was developed which may also be applicable to the purification of other proteins. The resulting mnemiopsin concentrate, after further purification, was judged to be about 90% pure by its gel electrophoretic profile. Estimates by molecular sieve chromatography and SDS gel electrophoresis gave a molecular weight of about 23,000 daltons. A calcium specificity for triggering light emission was studied by comparison of triggering with a variety of cations and anions and by investigating the effects of calcium ionophores and antagonists. The activity of mnemiospin was characterized with respect to pH, temperature and ionic strength. The stability of mnemiopsin activity after exposure to proteases, denaturants, protein group specific reagents, detergents, elevated temperatures and light was determined. Some years ago our laboratory reported that the bioluminescence reaction in the ctenophores which had long eluded definition involved a calcium activated photoprotein similar in many respects to that found in other coelenterates, notably Aequorea. We found, moreover, that the systems differed in that the bioluminescent activity of the isolated protein was lost following exposure to light. The purification and characterization of this biochemical system was undertaken both in our laboratory and by Ward and Seliger. These latter reports provide a detailed and firm foundation for the understanding of the components and mechanisms involved. While many of our results are in agreement with theirs, our approaches, inquiries, and results differed in several significant ways, the description of which forms the basis for this report. In particular, we took a different approach in the purification of the Mnemiopsis photoprotein which in itself is rather a formidable task. The technique was successful and may point the way to other applications where large volume dilute solutions prove cumbersome. Secondly, our study of the effects of salts, proteases, detergents, and other agents indicate that the protein, though sensitive to calcium and visible light inactivation, is relatively resistant to some agents which commonly inactivate proteins.",

So I performed this experiment. I made model of hair cells of silicon and poured three kinds of solutions of protein into them. And I checked the ionization of the protein and its denaturation by giving strong energy of oscillation to them like the same idea of photoelectric effect. As the result, as for the protein liquid, I noticed the increase of volts just after it was exposed to sound and about 3 hours later, I observed the figure decreased gradually. From this phenomenon, I presumed that the protein in sensory cells became a factor of the stimulation by receiving strong energy conversely. Low-percent protein liquid had less effect caused by sound."

      "Gonadotropin receptors in human corpora lutea of the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Binding of 125I-human choriogonadotropin (hCG) to homogenates of corpora lutea of the menstrual cycle and pregnancy was examined. While corpora lutea of the menstrual cycle bound 125I-hCG, most of the corpora lutea of pregnancy from six to 34 weeks' gestation bound little or none of the added 125 I-hCG. Further exploration into various possibilities for the above findings led to the conclusion that these corpora lutea either contain very few gonadotropin receptors or lack them altogether. The selected properties of gonadotropin receptors in corpora lutea of the cycle were studied. The apparent dissociation constant for binding was about the same (2.6 to 3.8 x 10-10M) in all but one corpus luteum. In this one sample the constant was three- to five-fold higher (1.3 x 10-9M). The binding was quite rapid and reversible, and it exhibited dependence on the amount of 125I-hCG, homogenate protein, pH of the incubation media, and duration of incubation. hCG and human lutropin (hLH') competed for 125I-hCG binding, but hCG subunits (alpha and beta), human follitropin, and ovine prolactin did not. Although hCG and hLH were parallel in inhibiting 125I-hCG binding, hLH was found to be relatively less effective. The studies with various enzymes revealed that gonadotropin receptors are protein in nature."

II. Limited polymorphism of idiotypic determinants on T-cell receptors specific for major histocompatibility complex alloantigens. These studies explore the extent of genetic polymorphism in the expression of anti-MHC receptors by T cells in different strains of rats. This question was approached with the use of the model of specifically induced GVH resistance in F1 rats which has been shown to reflect a specific T-cell mediated immune response against parental strain T cell anti-MHC receptors specific for host alloantigens. When A/B F1 rats derived from MHC incompatibile matings are immunized with lymphocytes from one parental strain (A they display a specific resistance to anti-B GVH reactivity caused by T cells from that parental strain, but not anti-AGVH reactions from the other. In addition, they resist anti-B GHV reactivity by T cells from third-party donors (C, D, E,...), a finding taken to indicate that the idiotypes of anti-MHC receptors on T cells, recognized by other T cells, show little or no polymorphism. This conclusion suggests that anti-MHC receptors are shared in the species and may be encoded, at least partially, by germ-line genes.",
      "The mediator of cellular immunity. XII. Inhibition of activated T cells by Newcastle disease virus. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) can interact in at least two ways with rat T cells. By adsorbing to circulating lymphocytes, the virus can transiently deflect the cells from lymph nodes and inflammatory exudates induced in the peritoneal cavity. T cells are affected regardless of age, state of activation, or position in the mitotic cycle. The effect is reversible and is mediated not only by infectious (I)-NDV, but also by UV-NDV which cannot achieve a complete replication cycle in eggs. But I-NDV has another lasting effect on activated T cells. It is revealed in the failure of virus-treated thoracic duct lymphocytes to transfer cellular resistance to Listeria monocytogenes, delayed-type hypersensitivity to soluble antigens of the parasite, and the permanent exclusion of labeled S-phase lymphocytes from inflammatory foci. Activated T cells are inhibited by virus multiplicites which have little if any effect upon  the proliferative potential of antigen-sensitive T cells or localization of labeled small lymphocytes in lymph nodes. The underlying mechanism has not been determined; however, there are reasons for thinking that NDV has a lethal effect upon activated T cells, because the latter are permissive for virus replication.",
      "Rabbit B spleen lymphocytes and T helper cells. I. Responsiveness to mitogens of B cell subpopulations of different sedimentation velocities and subpopulations bearing or lacking Fcgamma receptors. The response to anti-allotype (anti-Ab4), Nocardia Water Soluble Mitogen (NWSM), pneumococcal polysaccharide type III (SSS III), and human Fc fragments of various purified and unfractionated rabbit spleen cell populations was determined in terms of 3H-thymidine up-take. B cells were isolated either from untreated suspensions of spleen cells or from suspensions from which adherent and phagocytic cells were removed. The purification factor was greater than the enhancement of 3H-thymidine uptake by anti-Ab4, NWSM, and SSS III as compared with the response of unfractionated spleen cells. It thus appears that a helper cell was involved: the mitogen response of purified B cells was enhanced by the addition of T cells. B subpopulations were separated by sedimentation or by rosetting, which allowed us to separate Fcgamma receptor-bearing cells from cells that did not possess this receptor. There were differences between cells responding to B mitogens not only in sedimentation velocity but also in the absolute number of cells. B cells bearing the Fcgamma receptor were less responsive to anti-Ab4 and more responsive to SSS III, NWSM, and human Fc than were B cells lacking the Fcgamma receptor."

In one such species, Polysphondylium violaceum, we have isolated and purified its acrasin and determined some of its chemical properties, which lead us to believe it is a small molecule of less than 1500 daltons. One possibility is that it might be a peptide. The acrasin specifically attracts the amoebae of P. violaceum and P. pallidum and fails to do so for six species of Dictyostelium tested. We also have evidence for a specific acrasinase that inactivates the Polysphondylium acrasin.",
      "Adaptive responses of brain cyclic AMP-generating systems to alterations in synaptic input. The concept of subsensitivity and supersensitivity as a mechanism of neuronal adaptation to alterations in synaptic activity in the brain is an attractive one. However, the complexity of the central nervous system has made it difficult to determine the cellular basis of apparent changes in neuronal excitability resulting from alterations in synaptic input (cf. ref. 83). It now seems that, at least for inhibitory central pathways in which cyclic AMP-generating systems mediate postsynaptic receptor-responses, alterations in synaptic input lead in rat cortex to predictable super- or subsensitivity of the norepinephrine-sensitive cyclic AMP-systems. Supersensitivity of histamine-sensitive cyclic AMP-systems also occurs in rat cortex as a result of apparent lesions of histaminergic tracts. The reason that supersensitivity does not develop to norepinephrine and histamine in guinea pig cortex after similar \"denervations\" is not known, but is central to an understanding of the factors involved in the role of cyclic AMP-mechanisms to the adaptive plasticity of the central nervous system. However, even before an understanding of all the factors involved in alterations in cyclic AMP-responses in brain tissue is obtained, studies on the effects of environmental and drug-manipulations can provide insights both into the central roles for cyclic AMP-mechanisms and into the nature of drug action. Clearly, an understanding of the interelationships of synaptic input and adaptive changes in postsynaptic cyclic AMP-systems and the exploitation of such knowledge for the elucidation of central adaptive function is an exciting challenge for future research.",
      "Cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis in the thyroid gland. General properties and key role in the interrelations between concentrations of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate and guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate. Phosphodiesterase activities of horse (and dog) thyroid soluble fraction were compared with either cyclic AMP (adenosine 3':3'-monophosphate) or cyclic GMP (guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate) as substrate. Optimal activity for cyclic AMP hydrolysis was observed at pH 8, and at pH 7.6 for cyclic GMP. Increasing concentrations of ethyleneglycol bis(2-aminoethyl)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid inhibited both phosphodiesterase activities; in the presence of exogenous Ca2+, this effect was shifted to higher concentrations of the chelator. In a dialysed supernatant preparation, Ca2+ had no significant stimulatory effect, but both Mg2+ and Mn2+ increased cyclic nucleotides breakdown. Mn2+ promoted the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP more effectively than that of cyclic GMP. For both substrates, substrate velocity curves exhibited a two-slope pattern in a Hofstee plot. Cyclic GMP stimulated cyclic AMP hydrolysis, both nucleotides being at micromolar concentrations. Conversely, at no concentration had cyclic AMP any stimulatory effect on cyclic  GMP hydrolysis. 1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine and theophylline blocked the activation by cyclic GMP of cyclic GMP of cyclic AMP hydrolysis, whereas Ro 20-1724 (4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone), a non-methylxanthine inhibitor of phosphodiesterases, did not alter this effect. In dog thyroid slices, carbamoylcholine, which promotes an accumulation of cyclic GMP, inhibits the thyrotropin-induced increase in cyclic AMP. This inhibitory effect of carbamoylcholine was blocked by theophylline and 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, but not by Ro 20-1724. It is suggested that the cholinergic inhibitory effect on cyclic AMP accumulation is mediated by cyclic GMP, through a direct activation of phosphodiesterase activity."

The mechanisms of the low availability of endogenous folates in orange juice and the inhibitory effects on the availability of pteroylheptaglutamate (PteGlu7) caused by orange juice supplements were investigated in man by the use of simulated orange juice (containing the principal components: citric acid, malic acid, etc.) with several different pHs. The endogenous folates in orange juice were identified as mainly 5-methyl reduced derivatives of pteroylpolyglutamates (40-45% pentaglutamate, 10-15% tetraglutamate, 30-40% monoglutamate, and the rest were tri-and diglutamates). The availability of PteGlu7 is decreased to 54% by supplementation with 600 g concentrated orange juice (pH 3.7) and to 39% and 66% by the supplement of 24 g and 12 g citric acid (pH 3.7), respectively. Neutralization of 12 g citric acid to pH 6.4 largely reverses the inhibitory effect. On the other hand, the availability of pteroylmonoglutamate (PteGlu) is not influenced by a supplement of orange juice or citric acid. The results suggest that the low availability of PteGlu7 is due to the inhibition of intestinal conjugase caused by the low pH. These observations suggest that pH of foodstuffs may be an important factor in the absorption of polyglutamate forms of folate.",

      "Inhibition of lactate transport and glycolysis in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells by bioflavonoids. Bioflavonoids are potent inhibitors of lactate transport in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The most effective bioflavonoids have four to five hydroxyl groups. Sugar substitution at carbon three, or reduction of the double bond between carbons two and three, decreases their inhibitory activity. Quercetin, the most extensively studied of these compounds, inhibits lactate efflux by 50% at 0.1 micrograms/mg of protein. On addition of quercetin to glycolyzing Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, lactate accumulates inside the cell and the intracellular pH drops. Total lactate production is also inhibited. Nigericin prevents the internal acidification that occurs in the presence of quercetin and also reduces the inhibition of glycolysis. Thus, it appears that inhibition of lactate efflux can affect glycolysis through a lowering of the intracellular pH. The inhibitory effect of quercetin on glycolysis can be explained by its effect on lactate efflux and its previously reported effect on the Na+--K+ ATPase [Suolinna, E.--M., et al. (1974) J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 53, 1515]."

Leukocyte arylsulfatase A activity was decreased in all members of the girl's family, and sural nerve action potentials were abnormal in two asymptomatic siblings.

      "Ocular findings in metachromatic leukodystrophy. An electron microscopic and enzyme study in different clinical and genetic variants.

The lesions were limited to the optic, ciliary, and sensory nerves in a fourth patient with the juvenile form of the disorder. These morphological aspects, which are probably related to differences in sulfatase A activities, may explain the variability of the ocular manifestations in metachromatic leukodystrophy. Seven children affected with infantile MLD or with mucosulfatidosis were examined by conjunctival biopsy. Typical lesions of the sensory nerves were obvious and allowed the diagnosis of the disease. However, it seemed impossible to separate the different forms by histopathological studies only.

Compared with the Dnp group of the free hapten, 6-N-Dnp-aminohexanoate, the majority of the protein-bound Dnp groups were unavailable to the antibody at pH8.0. When the same Dnp-albumins were titrated at pH3.0 the availability of the Dnp groups increased approx. 3-fold. Dnp-albumins were treated with pepsin at pH3.0 and Dnp-containing fragments isolated by chromatography on DE-52 DEAE-cellulose. Fluorescence-quenching titrations showed that the Dnp groups on the fragments behaved like the free hapten with respect to quenching efficiency, although with an increased dissociation constant. The association between the Dnp-albumins and the antibody was measured also by difference-spectral titrations at high protein concentrations. Antibody binding was increased under these conditions, but the Dnp group of mono-Dnp-albumin remained unavailable to antibody. We propose that the reactive lysine residues are located in clefts between the globular sub-domains of the single polypeptide chain. Dnp groups attached to these lysine residues are fully exposed to the solvent, but binding of the macromolecular probe, anti-Dnp antibody, is sterically hindered by the adjacent surface of the albumin molecule.",
      "The use of gadolinium as a probe in the Fc region of a homogeneous anti-(type-III pneumococcal polysaccharide) antibody. The binding of gadolinium [Gd(III)] to a homogeneous rabbit anti-(type-III pneumococcal polysaccharide) IgG (immunoglobulin G) and its Fab (N-terminal half of heavy and light chain) and Fc (C-terminal half of heavy-chain dimer) fragments was demonstrated by measurements of solvent-water proton relaxation rates in the appropriate Gd(III) solutions. At pH 5.5 the binding of Gd(III) to the Fc fragment is much tighter (KD approx. 5 micronM) than binding to the Fab fragment (KD approx. 250 micronM). The binding of Gd(III) to the whole IgG molecule (KD approx. 4 micronM) is very similar to that for the Fc fragment alone. This specificity of binding to the Fc region allows the use of Gd(III) as a probe of the Fc conformation. The environment of the Gd(III) in the Fc region of whole IgG is not affected by the presence of octasaccharide derived by hydrolysis of type-III pneumococcal polysaccharide, but the corresponding 28-unit saccharide does cause detectable changes. The addition of 16-unit saccharide to anti-(SIII polysaccharide) IgG in the presence of Gd(III) does not change the solvent water proton relaxation rate, although aggregation does occur. The effects of the 28-unit saccharide may be explained therefore by a change in the tumbling time of the IgG. From a study of the effect of various antigen/antibody ratios, it is concluded that the 28-unit-saccharide-induced changes in the Gd(III) environment in the Fc region are caused by the specific geometrical structure of the antigen-antibody complexes formed, and not simply by occupancy of the combining sites on the antibody."

      "Low molecular weight C1q-precipitins in hypocomplementemic vasculitis-urticaria syndrome: partial purification and characterization as immunoglobulin. A lupus-like syndrome involving chronic urticaria with cutaneous vasculitis, systemic symptoms, hypocomplementemia with preferential depletion of C1q, and low m.w. (7S) C1q-precipitins has recently been defined. The C1q-precipitin activity (C1q-p) seems to represent a diagnostic marker of the disease, but its chemical nature is not yet clear. We have partially purified and characterized C1q-p from the serum of two patients with this syndrome and compared its activity with the C1q-precipitating activity of aggregated human gamma-globulin (AHGG) anti-C1q antibodies, and several polynucleotides including DNA and polyinosinic acid. C1q-p was found to partition with IgG during precipitation by ammonium sulfate and low ionic strength buffer as well as during column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose and G-200 Sephadex. Like AHGG, but in complete contrast to the polynucleotides, the C1q-precipitating activity of C1q-p was sensitive to pepsin, trypsin, and acidic conditions, but unaffected by DNAse or RNAse; the C1q-precipitating activity of anti-C1q antibody was not diminished by any of these procedures. Thus, C1q-p consists of gamma-migrating protein of low m.w., and its C1q-precipitating activity is indistinguishable from that of AHGG. These results are consistent with the concept that C1q-p is comprised, at least in part, of IgG that binds C1q via the Fc portion of the molecule.",

Perturbation of the polymerization of proteins by effectors. Theory is presented relating to the binding of an effector to two states of a protein acceptor coexisting in equilibrium. The problem is treated in terms of the four possible cases which specify relations between numbers of binding sites and intrinsic binding constants relevant to the acceptor states. It is shown that a distinction between these cases may be possible on the basis of the form of a plot of unbound effector concentration versus the constituent equilibrium coefficient which may be calculated from the sedimentation coefficient of the protein constituent. Particularly noteworthy in this respect is the finding that a turning point may exist in this plot for defined conditions with systems in which binding sites are not conserved (and binding affinities are altered) on polymer formation. The latter type of system is exemplified by studies on methaemoglobin A in 0.25 M sodium acetate, pH 5.4. In the absence of added organic phosphate effectors, a dimer-tetramer equilibrium operates governed by an association constant of 4.15 +/- 0.06 X 10(3) 1/mol, determined from sedimentation equilibrium results. Correlation of sedimentation velocity and equilibrium results shows that addition of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) results in its binding to one site on each of the dimeric (alpha beta) and tetrameric (alpha beta)2 species with intrinsic binding constants 1.03-10(3)-1.20-10(3) and 1.1-10(4)-2.1-10(4) 1/mol, respectively.

      "The interaction of macromolecular solutions with macromolecular monolayers adsorbed on a hydrophobic surface. In order to elucidate the general patterns of intermacromolecular surface interactions that may be involved in hemocompatibility phenomena, monolayers of representative macromolecules on an octadecylsilylated glass surface were exposed to solutions of other macromolecules, and the changes in interfacial composition were characterized by zeta potential-pH titration curves, as measured by alternating flow streaming current analysis and, in some cases, by radiotracer labeling. Experiments with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), a blood-compatible linear polymer; bovine serum albumin (BSA), a representative serum protein; whole human serum (HS), a complex mixture of proteins; and erythrocyte surface glycoprotein (GP), an extended-chain macromolecular amphiphile, showed the following: 1) Penetration of the original monolayer occurred within 24 hr in 9 of the 12 possible cases; it did not occur for BSA or HS monolayers exposed to PVP, and probably not for PVP exposed to GP. 2) In all cases, penetration was accompanied by no more than partial displacement of the original monolayer, thereby generating a mixed monolayer. Each of the six possible binary mixed monolayers could be obtained by at least one of the two possible mixing sequences. 3) In the three binary systems containing BSA, the formation of the mixed monolayer could be related to increased adsorption in the two-component system. 4) The two components of the mixed monolayers were not equally distributed across their thicknesses: thus, the outer surfaces of the PVP-BSA and (at neutral pH) the PVP-HS mixed monolayers contained only PVP; that of the BSA-HS mixtures only HS. In the PVP-HS, and probably the GP-BSA and GP-HS mixed monolayers, the composition of the outer surface appeared pH-dependent. The resultant zeta potential versus pH profiles in the latter two cases resembled those of intact blood cells. The results suggest that neither the compact monolayers of globular proteins nor the diffuse monolayers of randomly coiled water-soluble polymers can, by their prior adsorption on a synthetic surface, prevent the subsequent adsorption of other globular macromolecules. It is possible that the randomly coiled polymers may impede the adhesion of platelets to the substrate since the results indicate that the adsorption of such polymers causes a displacement of the shear plane."

At least two classes of high-affinity cyclic AMP-binding proteins have been identified: those derived from cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases (regulatory subunits) and those that bind a wide range of adenine analogues (adenine analogue-binding proteins). 2. In fresh-tissue extracts, regulatory subunits could be further subdivided into 'type I or 'type II' depending on whether they were derived from 'type I' or 'type II' protein kinase [see Corbin et al. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 218-225]. 3. The adenine analogue-binding protein was detected in crude tissue supernatant fractions of bovine and rat liver. It differed from the regulatory subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in many of its properties. Under the conditions of assay used, the protein accounted for about 45% of the binding of cyclic AMP to bovine liver supernatants. 4. The adenine analogue-binding protein from bovine liver was partially purified by DEAE-cellulose and Sepharose 6B chromatography. It had mol.wt. 185000 and was trypsin-sensitive. As shown by competition and direct binding experiments, it bound adenosine and AMP in addition to cyclic AMP. At intracellular concentrations of adenine nucleotides, binding of cyclic AMP was essentially completely inhibited in vitro. Adenosine binding was inhibited by only 30% under similar conditions. 5. Rat tissues were examined for the presence of the adenine analogue-binding protein, and, of those examined (adipose tissue, heart, brain, testis, kidney and liver), significant amounts were only found in the liver. The possible physiological role of the adenine analogue-binding protein is discussed. 6. Because the adenine analogue-binding protein or other cyclic AMP-binding proteins in tissues may be products of partial proteolysis of the regulatory subunit of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, the effects of trypsin and aging on partially purified protein kinase and its regulatory subunit from bovine liver were investigated. In all studies, the effects of trypsin and aging were similar. 7. In fresh preparations, the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase had mol.wt. 150000. Trypsin treatment converted it into a form of mol.wt 79500. 8. The regulatory subunit of the protein kinase had mol.wt. 87000. It would reassociate with and inhibit the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. Trypsin treatment of the regulatory subunit produced a species of mol.wt. 35500 which bound cyclic AMP but did not reassociate with the catalytic subunit. Trypsin treatment of the protein kinase and dissociation of the product by cyclic AMP produced a regulatory subunit of mol.wt. 46500 which reassociated with the catalytic subunit. 9. These results may be explained by at least two trypsin-sensitive sites on the regulatory subunit. A model for the effects of trypsin is described.",
      "Phosphorus-31 Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance study of mononucleotides and dinucleotides. 1. Chemical shifts. A phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study of adenine, uracil, and thymine mononucleotides, their cyclic analogues, and the corresponding dinucleotides is reported. From the pH dependence of phosphate chemical shifts, pKa values of 6.25-6.30 are found for all 5'-mononucleotides secondary phosphate ionization, independently from the nature of the base and the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 2' position. Conversely, substitution of a hydrogen atom for a 2'-OH lowers the pKa of 3'-monoribonucleotides from 6.25 down to 5.71-5.85. This indication of a strong influence of the 2'-hydroxyl group on the 3'-phosphate is confirmed by the existence of a 0.4 to 0.5 ppm downfield shift induced by the 2'-OH on the phosphate resonance of 3'-monoribonucleotides, and 3',5'-cyclic nucleotides and dinucleotides with respect to the deoxyribosyl analogues. Phosphate chemical shifts and titration curves are affected by the ionization and the type of the base. Typically, deviations from the theoretical Henderson-Hasselbalch plots are observed upon base titration. In addition, purine displays a more deshielding influence than pyrimidine on the phosphate groups of most of the mononucleotides (0.10 to 0.25 ppm downfield shift) with a reverse situation for dinucleotides. These effects together with the importance of stereochemical arrangement (furanose ring pucker, furanose-phosphate backbone conformation, O-P-O bond angle) on the phosphate chemical shifts are discussed.",
      "Binding protein for 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone in mouse submandibular gland. The changes in the levels of the binding protein for 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone in cytoplasmic extract of the submandibular glands during development were compared in male and female mice using a DEAE-cellulose filter assay. The binding protein was first detectable 5 days after birth in both sexes, at a time coincident with androgen-independent cytodifferentiation of the convoluted tubular cells in the submadibular gland. The level of the binding protein in female mice was maintained at 5 pmol/mg protein after birth, whereas in males it began to decrease from 3 weeks after birth with inccrease in serum testosterone, becoming much less than a quarter of the level in females or immature mice by 4 weeks after birth. However, after castration, the level of detectable binding protein in mature male mice increased within 7 days to the same level as that in females or immature mice. This suggests that the low binding capacity for exogenous hormone in mature male mice is due to occupancy of the binding sites by endogenous hormone."

      "The mediator of cellular immunity. XII. Inhibition of activated T cells by Newcastle disease virus. Newcastle disease virus (NDV) can interact in at least two ways with rat T cells. By adsorbing to circulating lymphocytes, the virus can transiently deflect the cells from lymph nodes and inflammatory exudates induced in the peritoneal cavity. T cells are affected regardless of age, state of activation, or position in the mitotic cycle. The effect is reversible and is mediated not only by infectious (I)-NDV, but also by UV-NDV which cannot achieve a complete replication cycle in eggs. But I-NDV has another lasting effect on activated T cells. It is revealed in the failure of virus-treated thoracic duct lymphocytes to transfer cellular resistance to Listeria monocytogenes, delayed-type hypersensitivity to soluble antigens of the parasite, and the permanent exclusion of labeled S-phase lymphocytes from inflammatory foci. Activated T cells are inhibited by virus multiplicites which have little if any effect upon  the proliferative potential of antigen-sensitive T cells or localization of labeled small lymphocytes in lymph nodes. The underlying mechanism has not been determined; however, there are reasons for thinking that NDV has a lethal effect upon activated T cells, because the latter are permissive for virus replication."

Purified cyclooxygenase, a single enzyme which catalyzes the formation of endoperoxide from arachidonic acid (20:4) in a bis(dioxygenase) reaction, is capable of oxygenating eicosadienoic acid (20:2) at C-11 in a single dioxygenase reaction. The partial oxygenation of 20:2 resembles the formation of prostaglandin from 20:4, with both oxygenation reactions exhibiting similar pH optima, substrate Km values, and cofactor effects including a need for peroxide and an absolute requirement for heme. In addition, those processes known to destroy 20:4 oxygenase activity, such as heat inactivation, inactivation with anti-inflammatory drugs, and turnover-mediated inactivation, have equally destructive effects on 20:2 oxygenase activity. Thus, both oxygenations are catalyzed by one enzyme. All of the above similarities for 20:2 and 20:4 oxygenation demonstrate that C-11 oxygenation is an integral rate-limiting step of cyclooxygenase action rather than a separate reaction resembling that of plant lipoxygenase.",
      "Comparison of the metabolism of parathion by a rat liver reconstituted mixed-function oxidase enzyme system and by a system containing cumene hydroperoxide and purified rat liver cytochrome P-450. The metabolism of parathion by a reconstituted mixed-function oxidase enzyme system (rat liver cytochrome P-450, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine, deoxycholate, and NADPH) or a cumene hydroperoxide system (cytochrome P-450, dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine, and cumene hydroperoxide) have been compared. The products formed on incubation of parathion with both systems were paraoxon, diethyl phosphorothioic acid, diethyl phosphoric acid, p-nitrophenol, and atomic sulfur. The apparent KM values for parathion for formation of paraoxon and diethyl phosphorothioic acid with the cumene hydroperoxide system were 55 and 39 X 10(-6) M, respectively.

      "Evidence for the different responses of delta9-, delta6- and delta5-fatty acyl-CoA desaturases to cytoplasmic proteins. Microsomes prepared from the livers of 4-week-old rats were, after extraction with 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, unable to catalyse either the delta6 desaturation of alpha-linolenic acid (9c.12c.15c., 18 : 3) into 6c.9c.12c.15c., 18 : 4 or the delta5 desaturation of eicosatrienoic acid (8c.11c.14c., 20 : 3) into arachidonic acid (5c.8c.11c.14c., 20 : 4). Both these enzymes only showed full activity after incubation of the microsomes with either the 100 000 X g supernatant fraction or with purified bovine catalase. Bovine serum albumin, while capable of restoring 50% of the delta5 desaturase activity has no effect on the delta6 desaturase. In contrast the delta9 desaturase activity of microsomes was never completely lost after extraction with buffer but could be stimulated by optimum concentrations of both bovine serum albumin and catalase. The significance of the different responses of the three desaturases to the cytoplasmic components is discussed."

      "Effects of metabolic and pharmacologic interventions on myocardial infarct size following coronary occlusion. A number of hemodynamic, pharmacologic and metabolic interventions were found to change the extent of acute ischemic injury of the myocardium and subsequent necrosis following experimental coronary artery occlusion. Reduction in myocardial damage occurred by decreasing myocardial oxygen demands (beta-adrenergic blocking agents, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, external counterpulsation, nitroglycerin, decreasing afterload in hypertensive patients, inhibition of lipolysis, and digitalis in the failing heart); by increasing myocardial oxygen supply either directly (coronary artery reperfusion or elevating arterial pO2),  or through collateral vessels (elevation of coronary perfusion pressure by alpha-adrenergic agonists, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation); or by increasing plasma osmolality (mannitol, hypertonic glucose); presumably by augmenting anaerobic metabolism (glucose-insulin-potassium, hypertonic glucose); by enhancing transport to the ischemic zone of substrates utilized in energy production (hyaluronidase); by protecting against autolytic and heterolytic damage (hydrocortisone, cobra venom factor, aprotinin). Augmentation of myocardial ischemic damage occurred as a consequence of increasing myocardial oxygen requirements (isoproterenol, glucagon, ouabain, bretylium tosylate, tachycardia); by decreasing myocardial oxygen supply either directly (hypoxia, anemia) or through reduction of collateral flow (hemorrhagic hypotension, minoxidil) or by decreasing substrate availability glycemia). Pilot studies have been carried out in patients with hyaluronidase, nitroglycerin, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, beta-blocking agents and Arfonad and have shown that these interventions may also reduce myocardial damage, suggesting that the concept of reduction in infarct size following coronary occlusion is applicable clinically.",
      "Role of blood platelets in coronary artery disease. Over the past decade, research in blood platelet physiology has led to the suggestion that platelets play an important part in the pathogenesis and complications of coronary artery disease. Occlusive intravascular platelet aggregates have been shown to cause ischemic myocardial damage in the experimental animal and to be present in some patients who die suddenly. The interplay between endothelial damage and platelet aggregation has been implicated in the etiology of atherosclerosis. Products released from platelets during aggregation may cause arterial spasm. Patients with overt ischemic heart disease and with the risk factors associated with coronary artery disease have been found to have abnormally reactive platelets. Clinical studies of drugs that inhibit platelet aggregation have been reported to show a beneficial effect in preventing cardiac deaths or myocardial infarction; other studies have been negative or shown only a trend toward benefit. This report reviews the theoretical and experimental basis for the platelet hypothesis and the current data on the use of antiplatelet drugs in patients with coronary disease."

This enzyme was shown to catalyze the conversion of 4.5 S precursor RNA to 4.1 S RNA by trimming the 5'-additional segment from the precursor RNA. RNase P.Bmo required divalent cations, Mg2+ or Mn2+. In the presence of these divalent cations, K+ or NH4+ activated the RNase P.Bmo reaction. Optimum pH was observed around 8.0. Ribosomal RNA's and mature tRNA from the silk gland were not cleaved by RNase P.Bmo. A 4.5 S precursor RNA fraction containing formycin, an adenosine analog, was less susceptible to RNase P.Bmo than the normal one.

      "Differential, structure-dependent susceptibility of poly(A) and RNA to monomeric and dimeric pancreatic ribonuclease A. Cross-linked dimers of bovine RNAase A are definitely more efficient than monomers at degrading polyadenylic acid under conditions of ionic strength and pH, where the polymer assumes either a double-helical or an ordered single-stranded, base-stacked structure. The opposite occurs, i.e., monomers of RNAase A are definitely more active than dimers,when poly(A) is digested by the two enzyme species under conditions where the conformation of the polymer is essentially that of a random coil. The same pattern of events occurs when total RNA from Escherichia coli or single-stranded RNA of f2 sus11 bacteriophage are used as substrates under opposite ionic-strength conditions. In the presence of high salt concentrations, favouring the formation and the stability of a secondary structure in self-complementary sequences of RNA, the ribonucleic acids are degraded at a higher rate by dimers than by monomers of bovine RNAase A. The opposite occurs in the presence of very low salt concentrations, i.e. when the RNAs are in solution presumably as random coils. These observations are discussed in the light of a hypothesis already advanced to understand the mechanism of enzymic degradation of secondary structures of polyribonucleotides."

The mechanisms of the low availability of endogenous folates in orange juice and the inhibitory effects on the availability of pteroylheptaglutamate (PteGlu7) caused by orange juice supplements were investigated in man by the use of simulated orange juice (containing the principal components: citric acid, malic acid, etc.) with several different pHs. The endogenous folates in orange juice were identified as mainly 5-methyl reduced derivatives of pteroylpolyglutamates (40-45% pentaglutamate, 10-15% tetraglutamate, 30-40% monoglutamate, and the rest were tri-and diglutamates). The availability of PteGlu7 is decreased to 54% by supplementation with 600 g concentrated orange juice (pH 3.7) and to 39% and 66% by the supplement of 24 g and 12 g citric acid (pH 3.7), respectively. Neutralization of 12 g citric acid to pH 6.4 largely reverses the inhibitory effect. On the other hand, the availability of pteroylmonoglutamate (PteGlu) is not influenced by a supplement of orange juice or citric acid. The results suggest that the low availability of PteGlu7 is due to the inhibition of intestinal conjugase caused by the low pH. These observations suggest that pH of foodstuffs may be an important factor in the absorption of polyglutamate forms of folate.",

      "Inhibition of lactate transport and glycolysis in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells by bioflavonoids. Bioflavonoids are potent inhibitors of lactate transport in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The most effective bioflavonoids have four to five hydroxyl groups. Sugar substitution at carbon three, or reduction of the double bond between carbons two and three, decreases their inhibitory activity. Quercetin, the most extensively studied of these compounds, inhibits lactate efflux by 50% at 0.1 micrograms/mg of protein. On addition of quercetin to glycolyzing Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, lactate accumulates inside the cell and the intracellular pH drops. Total lactate production is also inhibited. Nigericin prevents the internal acidification that occurs in the presence of quercetin and also reduces the inhibition of glycolysis. Thus, it appears that inhibition of lactate efflux can affect glycolysis through a lowering of the intracellular pH. The inhibitory effect of quercetin on glycolysis can be explained by its effect on lactate efflux and its previously reported effect on the Na+--K+ ATPase [Suolinna, E.--M., et al. (1974) J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 53, 1515]."

This question was approached with the use of the model of specifically induced GVH resistance in F1 rats which has been shown to reflect a specific T-cell mediated immune response against parental strain T cell anti-MHC receptors specific for host alloantigens. When A/B F1 rats derived from MHC incompatibile matings are immunized with lymphocytes from one parental strain (A they display a specific resistance to anti-B GVH reactivity caused by T cells from that parental strain, but not anti-AGVH reactions from the other. In addition, they resist anti-B GHV reactivity by T cells from third-party donors (C, D, E,...), a finding taken to indicate that the idiotypes of anti-MHC receptors on T cells, recognized by other T cells, show little or no polymorphism. This conclusion suggests that anti-MHC receptors are shared in the species and may be encoded, at least partially, by germ-line genes.",
      "The use of gadolinium as a probe in the Fc region of a homogeneous anti-(type-III pneumococcal polysaccharide) antibody. The binding of gadolinium [Gd(III)] to a homogeneous rabbit anti-(type-III pneumococcal polysaccharide) IgG (immunoglobulin G) and its Fab (N-terminal half of heavy and light chain) and Fc (C-terminal half of heavy-chain dimer) fragments was demonstrated by measurements of solvent-water proton relaxation rates in the appropriate Gd(III) solutions. At pH 5.5 the binding of Gd(III) to the Fc fragment is much tighter (KD approx. 5 micronM) than binding to the Fab fragment (KD approx. 250 micronM). The binding of Gd(III) to the whole IgG molecule (KD approx. 4 micronM) is very similar to that for the Fc fragment alone. This specificity of binding to the Fc region allows the use of Gd(III) as a probe of the Fc conformation. The environment of the Gd(III) in the Fc region of whole IgG is not affected by the presence of octasaccharide derived by hydrolysis of type-III pneumococcal polysaccharide, but the corresponding 28-unit saccharide does cause detectable changes. The addition of 16-unit saccharide to anti-(SIII polysaccharide) IgG in the presence of Gd(III) does not change the solvent water proton relaxation rate, although aggregation does occur. The effects of the 28-unit saccharide may be explained therefore by a change in the tumbling time of the IgG. From a study of the effect of various antigen/antibody ratios, it is concluded that the 28-unit-saccharide-induced changes in the Gd(III) environment in the Fc region are caused by the specific geometrical structure of the antigen-antibody complexes formed, and not simply by occupancy of the combining sites on the antibody.",

Prolactin. A sensitive and specific assay for human prolactin has been developed using human prolactin and antiserum distributed by the United States National Pituitary Agency. Plasma prolactin concentrations in control subjects ranged from 0-20 ng/ml. No sex difference in prolactin concentration was observed. A brisk increase in plasma prolactin levels occurred in normal subjects during the administration of chlorpromazine and thyroid stimulating hormone releasing factor (TRH). These stimulatory tests of prolactin release should therefore be useful in the assessment of hypothalamic pituitary function. Basal plasma prolactin values were raised in most patients who were being treated with phenothiazines and were helpful diagnostically in patients with amenorrhoea, galactorrhoea, hypogonadism, cranio-pharyngioma, \"non-functioning\" pituitary tumours and acromegaly. In many of these disorders a significant reduction in the plasma prolactin concentration was observed following oral administration of bromocriptine. Plasma prolactin determinations should be useful in evaluating the response to medical treatment or pituitary ablation.",
      "[Aminoacid-p-nitroanilides splitting activities in the mature human placenta (author's transl)]. A long experience in the treatment of endometrial cancer shows that the therapeutic measures vary considerably with regard to the extention of the tumor, the age of the patient and her general condition. This circumstances and particularly the critical study of the therapeutical results give the limits, within a certain kind of operation can reasonably be recommended. The intercurrent deaths are an important factor in the statistical evaluation of therapeutical success. As long as the tumor is limited to the body of the uterus, the corrected 5-year recoveries are about 90%. Considering all the circumstances, it becomes obvious, that in this stage, the simple abdominal hysterectomy with removal of the adnexa is still the operation of choice. Beside the histological degree of differentiation, the depth of the muscular invasion is the most important prognostic factor which might lead to additional measures. Postoperative radiation therapy of the vagina reduces considerably the incidence possibility of vaginal apex recurrence. In stage II radical hysterectomy must be considered, although we are aware of the fact, that a simple hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy combined with radiation treatment may yield just as good results. In the clinical stage III laparotomy ought to be used more frequently. Also in case of operative intervention additional radiotherapy is mostly useful.",
      "Carcinoma-in-situ of the cerivix treated with colposcopy guided epithelial conization. Report of a 4-7 year follow-up study. Twenty-five patients with the diagnosis of carcinoma-in-situ (CIS) of the cervix were treated with colposcopy guided epithelial conization. During the follow-up study of 4-7 years' duration, there was no recurrence of CIS in 20 of the 25 patients. Between 6 and 12 months after conization, 3 patients showed recurrence of CIS. Two of these patients were treated with further epithelial conization with no evidence of further recurrence 4 years after the second treatment. The third  patient refused to accept further epithelial conization and modified radical hysterectomy was done without any evidence of residual tumour in the hysterectomy specimen. One patient showed stromal invasion in both colposcopically guided biopsy and bone biopsy. Modified radical hysterectomy specimen showed remnants of stromal invasion. One patient with Class IV smear failed to show any atypical transformation zone and cervicitis was proven on colposcopy guided biopsy following treatment with Flagyl. For two of the 25 patients, cytology was Class II and therefore failed to diagnose the pre-malignant condition; but colposcopy showed a grade 3 atypical transformation zone and the presence of CIS was confirmed histologically. Simultaneous use of cytology, colposcopy and colposcopically guided biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CIS in all cases. The authors recommend colposcopically guided epithelial conization in younger patients, provided the malignant lesion is strictly intra-epithelial, and limited to the ectocervix. Routine follow-up with the aid of cyto-colposcopy remains the key factor in this schedule of therapy."

      "Histofluorescence study on monoamine entry into the brain before and after opening of the blood-brain barrier by various mechanisms. The relationship between exogenous, circulating monoamines to the wall of cerebral microvessels, and the entrance of these amines into the cerebral parenchyma was studied by the formaldehyde histofluorescence technique in rats. No monoamine fluorescence could be detected in the wall tissue of the microvessels (pericytes and andothelial cells) unless either MAO or COMT were inhibited; these are integral to the blood-brain barrier mechanisms to monoamines. After transient opening of the morphologic blood-brain barrier by either a hypertonic of hypertensive insult, the amine fluorescence in the walls of the microvessels was intensified compared to that which was noted after monoamine oxidase inhibition by itself. Following opening of the structural blood-brain barrier, the circulating amines also passed through into the neuropil where they were concentrated within neurons, as demonstrated by prior depletion of endogenous monoamine transmitters by reserpine. Thus, both enzymatic and morphologic mechanisms in the blood-brain barrier ar involved in impeding the passage of monoamines into the cerebral parenchyma."

The dependence of net charge and oxygen affinity of human hemoglobin upon hemoglobin concentration was reinvestigated.

Two findings indicate a concentration-independent net charge of carbonmonoxy hemoglobin at pH 6.6: (A) The pH value of a given carbonmonoty hemoglobin solution remains constant at 6.6 when the hemoglobin concentration is raised from 10 to 40 g/dl, indicating that there is no change in protonation of titratable groups of hemoglobin: (b) the net charge of carbonmonoxy hemoglobin as estimated from the Donnan distribution of 22Na+ shows no dependence on hemoglobin concentration in this concentration range. The oxygen affinity of human hemoglobin was determined from measurements of oxygen concentrations in equilibrated samples using a Lex-O2-Con apparatus (Lexington Instruments, Waltham, Mass.).

      "CO and O2 complexes of soybean leghemoglobins: pH effects upon infrared and visible spectra. Comparisons with CO and O2 complexes of myoglobin and hemoglobin. The effects of pH upon infrared spectra [CO stretching frequency (vco) region] and visible spectra of the CO complexes of soybean leghemoglobins a, c1, and c2, sperm whale myoglobin, and human hemoglobin A  are reported. The vco for leghemoglobin--CO complexes was 1947.5 cm-1 at neutral pH. At acid pH myoglobin-- and hemoglobin--CO complexes developed vco bands at 1966--1968 cm-1, whereas leghemoglobin--CO complexes developed vco bands at approximately 1957 cm-1. All pKapp co values determined by pH-dependent variation of vco fell in the range 4.0--4.6. The pKapp co values determined from visible spectra were consistent with vco-determined values except for that of myoglobin--CO (visible pKapp co = 5.8). The pKapp co values in the 4.0--4.6 range appear to be pK values of the distal histidines, while the visible pKapp co of myoglobin--CO appears to be the pK of a group other than the distal and proximal histidines. The data are consistent with a model in which protonation of the distal histidine permits protein-free heme FeCO geometry in leghemoglobin--CO complexes but not in myoglobin-- or hemoglobin--CO complexes. Thus the heme pockets of leghemoglobins appear to be more flexible than the heme pockets of myoglobin and hemoglobin. The effects of pH upon visible spectra of the O2 complexes of soybean leghemoglobins a, c1, and c2, sperm whale myoglobin, and human hemoglobin A also are reported. pKapp o2 values of approximately 5.5 (leghemoglobins) and 4.4 (hemoglobin) are probably the pK values of the distal histidines. Comparisons of pKapp o2 values with pKapp co values indicate a more flexible heme pocket in leghemoglobins than in hemoglobin. The O2 complex of leghemoglobin c2 differed significantly from the O2 complexes of leghemoglobins a and c1 in visible spectra and titration behavior. These differences  might be associated with the small structural differences in the region between the E and F helixes of leghemoglobins.",
      "X-ray and functional studies of hemoglobins Nancy and Cochin-Port-Royal. The mutations in hemoglobin Nancy beta145(HC2) Tyr leads to Asp and hemoglobin Cochin-Portal-Royal beta146(HC3) His leads to Arg involve residues which are thought to be essential for the full expression of allosteric action in hemoglobin. Relative to the structure of deoxyhemoglobin A, our x-ray study of deoxyhemoglobin Nancy shows severe disordering of the beta chain COOH-terminal tetrapeptide and a possible movement of the beta heme iron atom toward the plane of the porphyrin ring. These structural perturbations result in a high oxygen affinity, reduced Bohr effect, and lack of cooperatively in hemoglobin Nancy. In the presence of inositol hexaphosphate (IHP), the Hill constant for hemoglobin Nancy increases from 1.1 to 2.0. But relative to its action on hemoglobin A, IHP is much less effective in reducing the oxygen affinity and in increasing the Bohr effect of hemoglobin Nancy. This indicates that IHP does not influence the R in equilibrium T equilibrium as much in hemoglobin Nancy as in hemoglobin A, and this probably is due to the disordering of His 143beta which is known to be part of the IHP binding site. IHP is also known to produce large changes in the absorption spectrum of methemoglobin A, but we find that it has no effect on the spectrum of methemoglobin Nancy. In contrast to the large structural changes in deoxyhemoglobin Nancy, the structure of deoxyhemoglobin Cochin-Port-Royal differs from deoxyhemoglobin A only in the position of the side chain of residue 146beta. The intrasubunit salt bridge between His 146beta and Asp 94beta in deoxyhemoglobin A is lost in deoxyhemoglobin Cochin-Portal-Royal with the guanidinium ion of Arg 146beta floating freely in solution. This small difference in structure results in a reduced Bohr effect, but does not cause a change in the Hill coefficient, the response to 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, or the oxygen affinity at physiological pH."

The phototoxic reaction to coal tar was found to be a two-stage process, an immediate wheal associated with sharp burning, followed by a raised, red, infiltrated lesion peaking at 24 to 48 hours. The phototoxic reaction was completely prevented when arterial blood flow was cut off.

The effect of preirradiated chlorpromazine (CPZ) solutions has been studied in vivo in the guinea pig and in vitro in a yeast culture.

Preirradiated CPZ was not toxic to the yeast culture. During irradiation the pH of the CPZ solution changed, indicating an accumulation of acid photoproducts. Nonphototoxic phenothiazines and related tricyclic drugs failed to change their pH following irradiation whereas phototoxic compounds behaved like CPZ. The low pH alone could not account for the inflammatory response in vivo, as neutralized irradiated CPZ solutions still induced inflammation, and acidified, nonirradiated solutions failed to cause a reaction. CPZ phototoxicity seems mainly to be due to the effect of photoproducts. The nature of these is not known, but it is suggested that the stable free radical of CPZ might be an active principle.",

The discovery of interferon in 1957 by Drs. Isaacs and Lindenmann led to major revisions in the concepts of man's defenses against viral infections. There are at least two types of interferon. Along with their antiviral properties, they have recently been shown to exert a suppressive effect on the humoral and cellular immune response; they affect both B and T lymphocytes. A variety of substances, including virus, polyribonucleotides, and mitogens for T lymphocytes, are good interferon inducers. T lymphocytes seem to be necessary for these inducers to exert their immunosuppressive effects. The immunosuppressive effects of interferon inducers suggests that interferons may be mediators of suppressor T lymphocyte effects. In the virus system, interferon does not exert its antiviral effects by direct action on the virus, but rather derepresses a cell gene that results in the production of an antiviral protein. This antiviral protein is probably the mediator of inhibition of virus replication. This is a complex sequence of events that results in the interaction of interferon with the cell membrane and the resulting production of the antiviral state in the cell. This review will examine the various steps of this involved process.",
      "Phosphofructokinase. III. Correlation of the regulatory kinetic and molecular properties of the rabbit muscle enzyme. It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation.",
      "Monoclonal IgG1 immunoglobulinaemia with strictly pH dependent cryoprecipitability. A monoclonal IgG1 lambda protein with peculiar cryoprecipitable characteristics was found in the serum of a patient with advanced multiple myeloma. The cryoprecipitate was observed only when the serum was exposed to the air. Further studies defined this phenomenon as being strictly pH-dependent. No antiglobulin activity (rheumatoid factor) was detected in the cryoglobulin. The isoelctric focussing of isolated cryoglobulin showed four distinct fractions around the pH 7.8 zone, which was comparable to the pH at which the cryoprecipitate began to form. Electrostatic bonds probably contribute to the mechanism involved in the formation of cryoprecipitate in this case."

DMSO was also active against bromobenzene- and thioacetamide-induced hepatotoxicity, but failed to protect mice against carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage. Hepatic glutathione depletion in mice amounting to 94% after paracetamol (0.5 g kg-1, orally) and to 60% after bromobezene (0.25 ml kg-1, orally) was dose-dependently reduced by the simultaneous administration of DMSO(0.25--1.0 G KG-1, I.P.).

      "Presence and properties of thymidylate synthase in trypanosomatids. High speed centrifugal supernatant fractions of homogenates of a number of trypanosomatids were assayed for thymidylate synthase (5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate: dUMP C-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.45) activity using the method of Lomax and Greenberg (1967) J. Biol. Chem. 242, 109-113). Similar activities were detected in Crithidia fasciculata, Crithidia oncopelti, the blood forms of Trypanosoma brucei, Trypansoma congolense and Trypanosoma lewisi and the blood, intracellular and culture forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, suggesting that all species synthesize at least some thymidylate de novo. The properties of the activities in C. fasciculata and the three forms of T. cruzi were compared with those of the isofunctional bacterial and mammalian enzymes. The trypanosotamid enzyme was inhibited by Mg2+, was much more sensitive to mercaptoethanol, had higher apparent Km values for substrate (dUMP) and cofactor (tetrahydrofolate), had a higher apparent molecular weight and was markedly more sensitive to inhibition by suramin. It is, therefore a possible target for chemotherapeutic attack, either on its own or in combination with a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor. No evidence was obtained for the regulation of the trypanosomatid enzyme, either by its product, dTMP, or by dTDP or dTTp. This result agrees with previous studies which suggested that in trypanosomatids, the level of dTMP was regulated, at least in part, by a catabolic pathway consisting of a thymidylate phosphatase and a thymidine phosphorylase which degraded the excess of dTMP to thymine."

The vitelline envelope (VE) that surrounds an egg released from the ovary into the coelom of Xenopus laevis differs markedly, in structure and penetrability, from the VE surrounding an oviposited egg. In a coelomic egg, the filaments that form the VE are arranged in distinct fascicles or bundles. The exterior surface of the VE is irregular in contour and is permeated by channels. In an oviposited egg, the filaments are evenly dispersed and lack a fasciculated arrangement; the exterior surface is smooth and no channels are present. The fascicular arrangement of fibrils in the coelomic VE is maintained only at neutral pH, and is not visibly altered by the cortical reaction. VEs from coelomic eggs retain their fasciculated morphology after isolation from the egg. In an in vitro test system, sperm penetrated VEs isolated from oviposited eggs, but failed to penetrate VEs isolated from coelomic eggs. The structural transformation of the VE from the coelomic type to the oviposited type occurs in the first 1-cm segment of the oviduct, prior to addition of jelly to the egg. Neither intact jelly, solubilized jelly, nor jelly extracts were capable of altering the structural organization of coelomic VEs, suggesting that the structural transformation of the VE is effected by some oviducal factor other than jelly.",
      "A trypsin-like oviducal proteinase involved in Bufo arenarum fertilization. When the jelly-less eggs removed from the most cephalic region of the oviduct (pars recta) of the toad Bufo arenarum were inseminated at a high sperm concentration, high frequencies of fertilization were obtained. On the other hand, control eggs removed from the pleuroperitoneal cavity (coelomic eggs)) were neither fertilized upon insemination under identical conditions, nor with the water extract of the jelly. Under these inseminating conditions, however, a high frequency of fertilization was obtained when coelomic eggs were preincubated in the presence of the fluid secreted by the epithelium of the pars recta or of an extract prepared from pars recta homogenate. Experimental evidence is presented showing that the component responsible for this effect acts on the vitelline envelope of the egg, increasing its susceptibility to sperm lysin. It is probable, therefore, that it induces successful fertilization of coelomic eggs by making the vitelline envelope more easily penetrable by sperm. The active factor was partially purified by Sephadex chromatography. The product obtained was of high activity and, as judged by its inhibition with soybean trypsin inhibitor and lima-bean trypsin inhibitor, it is likely to be a trypsin-like enzyme. The molecular weight of the factor was estimated to be 47000 by Sephadex chromatography. Secretion of the pars recta factor is hypophysis-dependent and its activity is not influenced by pH within the range testes (6.0--8.4).",

The catalytic properties of the renal carcinoma gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase were almost the same as those of normal kidney except for molecular weight; the molecular weight for the renal carcinoma was estimated to be about 130 000, while that of normal kidney was about 90 000.

      "Characterization of an established cell line from human renal carcinoma. A cell line, designated as OUR-10, has been established from a renal carcinoma in a Japanese woman. This cell line forms monolayers of polygonal epithelial cells with scattered round or dendritic cells and exhibits multilayering. With electron microscopy, differentiated surface structures that resemble the microvilli characteristic of renal carcinomas can be seen even at the 60th transfer. The cells have a hypodiploid karyotype with modal numbers of 39 and 40. No marker chromosomes were seen, but definite nonrandom loss of three chromosomes in Group D and one in Group E were recognized. The doubling time was estimated as approximately 32 hr in exponentially growing cultures, and the cells formed colonies in soft agar with an average efficiency of 25%. Heterotransplantation into the cheek pouch of immunosuppressed hamsters produced tumors that were histologically similar to the original cancerous tissue. The electrophoretic mobility of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase extracted from the cells coincided with that of a novel isozyme found in human renal carcinoma tissue, and the genetic phenotype of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was proved to be the B phenotype. The antigenic structure of HLA was determined as HLA-A2, 11; B5, 40, which was the same as that of peripheral blood lymphocytes of the woman with renal carcinoma."

Veratridine causes deplorization of excitable cells and produces marked elevation of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) levels in incubated slices of mouse cerebral cortex. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, phensuximide, methsuximide, alpha-methyl-alpha-phenylsuccinimide, and high concentrations of clonazepam are anticonvulsant drugs that preferentially prevent maximal electroshock seizures (MES) and generalized tonic-clonic convulsions; all these agents inhibit veratridine-induced accumulation of both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP. In contrast, ethosuximide, trimethadione, valproic acid, and low concentrations of clonazepam are anticonvulsant drugs that act predominantly against Metrazol and absence seizures; these agents are ineffective or inhibit accumulation of only cyclic GMP. The results suggest that inhibition of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP accumulation in depolarized brain tissue is a molecular neuropharmacological action characteristic of anticonvulsant drugs that have direct effects on cellular membrane function and prevent MES. Anticonvulsant drugs that do not inhibit accumulation of both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP in depolarized brain tissue preferentially prevent Metrazol and absence seizures and probably exert their effects by altering neurotransmission mechanisms.",
      "[Value of cerebral metabolic exploration in post-traumatic coma states in the acute phase]. The authors report the values of mean hemispheric blood-flow and cerebral arterial consumption they found in 34 neurosurgical comatous cases in acute state. In basal conditions, mean values of mean hemispheric bloodflow and oxygen consumption are lowered. There seems to be a relation between the values found and the comatous stage on one hand, the prognosis on the other hand. The cerebral response to hypercapnia (16 assays) allows to separate 2 groups, one with a noticeable improvement of cerebral bloodflow, the other with only a minimal response. There was no significant variation of cerebral oxygen consumption in both group. Cerebral response to CO2 seems to be clearly related to the stage of coma (low in the most severe cases) but pronostic incidence remained uncertain. A hypertensive test by means of Aramine (18 assays) allows to separate 3 groups : 1 group (8 cases) where the mean hemispheric bloodflow remained stable during hypertension as did the cerebral oxygen consumption -(autoregulation remained unchanged), 1 group (4 cases) where mean hemispheric bloodflow and cerebral oxygen consumption were lowered (excessive autoregulation), 1 group (6 cases) where mean hemispheric bloodflow increases clearly while under Aramine perfusion (loss of autoregulation). Those dynamic tests, either hypercapnic or hypertensive, allow, in comparing oxygen consumption variations with cerebral bloodflow variations, the distinction between : patients where metabolic autoregulation seems maintained (good prognosis) - (10 cases), patients where metabolic regulation is lost with either \"luxury perfusion\" (14 cases) - poor prognosis, or \"insufficient perfusion\" (10 cases). The authors are discussing the treatment concerning those last mentioned patients.",
      "[Influence of combined moderate arterial hypoxaemia and moderate hypovolaemic hypotension on cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxidative and energy metabolism in the dog (author's transl)]. The influence on total cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rates for oxygen, carbon dioxide, glucose, lactate and pyruvate and on cerebral grey matter content of glucose, lactate and pyruvate and high energy phosphate compounds of combined moderate reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and moderate arterial hypoxaemia was studied. Individually arterial hypoxaemia and arterial hypotension of the same degree would neither impair autoregulation of cerebral blood flow nor cerebral oxygen availability. Four groups of 10 dogs each were studied under control conditions (group I), with reduction of CPP to 70 mm Hg (group II), with reduction of paO2 to 45 mm Hg (group III) or with a combination of these degrees of hypotension and hypoxaemia (group IV) after steady states of 30 min duration. Cbf was elevated by 40% in group III (p less than or equal to 0.01), CMRO2 was reduced significantly in group IV (p less than or equal to 0.01, CMR lactate was raised significantly in all three experimental groups (p less than or equal to 0.01). All other data were not significantly different from values in control animals. Cerebral tissue lactate content was elevated significantly in groups II to IV as compared to controls (less than or equal to 0.05); changes in cerebral tissue content of glucose and energy rich phosphate compounds were not statistically significant. From the seemingly normal cerebral blood flow in hypotensive-hypoxaemic dogs it is concluded that autoregulation of cerebral blood flow has become ineffective because of vasodilatation consequent upon arterial hypoxaemia. Reduction of CMRO2 in this group points to metabolic insufficiency and to relative cerebral hypoperfusion, but since changes in cerebral content of high energy phosphate compounds were not significant, severe tissue hypoxia may be excluded. The increase in cerebral tissue lactate content is attributable to increased glycolytic activity known from hypotensive and hypoxaemic states. The present investigation suggests that in patients with hypoxaemia and hypotension, brain function may be endangered by a similarly marked change of circulatory and metabolic parameters."

      "Structure, composition, physical properties, and turnover of proliferated peroxisomes. A study of the trophic effects of Su-13437 on rat liver. Peroxisome proliferation has been induced with 2-methyl-2-(p-[1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthyl]-phenoxy)-propionic acid (Su-13437). DNA, protein, cytochrome oxidase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and acid phosphatase concentrations remain almost constant. Peroxisomal enzyme activities change to approximately 165%, 50%, 30%, and 0% of the controls for catalase, urate oxidase, L-alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase, and D-amino acid oxidase, respectively. For catalase the change results from a decrease in particle-bound activity and a fivefold increase in soluble activity. The average diameter of peroxisome sections is 0.58 +/- 0.15 mum in controls and 0.73 +/- 0.25 mum after treatment. Therefore, the measured peroxisomal enzymes are highly diluted in proliferated particles. After tissue fractionation, approximately one-half of the normal peroxisomes and all proliferated peroxisomes show matric extraction with ghost formation, but no change in size. In homogenates submitted to mechanical stress, proliferated peroxisomes do not reveal increased fragility; unexpectedly, Su-13437 stabilizes lysosomes. Our results suggest that matrix extraction and increased soluble enzyme activities result from transmembrane passage of peroxisomal proteins. The changes in concentration of peroxisomal oxidases and soluble catalase after Su-13437 allow the calculation of their half-lives. These are the same as those found for total catalase, in normal and treated rats, after allyl isopropyl acetamide: about 1.3 days, a result compatible with peroxisome degradation by autophagy. A sequential increase in liver RNA concentration, [14C]leucine incorporation into DOC-soluble proteins and into immunoprecipitable catalase, and an increase in liver size and peroxisomal volume per gram liver, characterize the trophic effect of the drug used. In males, Su-13437 is more active than CPIB, another peroxisome proliferation-inducing drug; in females, only Su-13437 is active.",
      "Differentiated regions of human placental cell surface associated with attachment of chorionic villi, phagocytosis of maternal erythrocytes and syncytiotrophoblast repair. Scanning electron micrographs of human placental cell surface show: (1) Differentiated zones of trophoblast which may be covered by fewer 'microvilli' than the adjacent syncytial cell surface and which extend as a narrow, usually distal protrusion of the chorionic villus. This narrow outgrowth terminates as a fractured end. Presumably since preparations were obtained from therapeutic terminations of pregnancy or Caesarian deliveries these broken ends represent the yield point in the anchoring 'villi' ruptured as a result of surgery. Similar anchoring 'villi' with fractured ends were observed in unfixed material with the use of Nomarski interference contrast microscopy. (2) It appears that, during apparent phagocytic uptake of maternal erythrocytes by syncytiotrophoblast, cell surface lining the forming vacuole still retains an irregular microvillous surface. This observation indicates the potential location of phagocytosis receptors for red blood cells in the placental cell surface. (3) Areas of human placenta which appears to have been damaged and may be undergoing repair exhibit masses of cells with conspicuous microvillar cell surfaces. The origin of these cells is discussed in relation to the usual processes of syncytiotrophoblast formation."

The effects of 17-beta-oestradiol in 14 women who had had intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (hepatosis) were studied. This natural oestrogen was given orally in a daily dose of 5 mg for two 20-day periods with a 7-day interval between courses. The bromsulphthalein (BSP) retention rose during the treatment, but only occasionally to levels above the upper limit of normal. Other conventional liver function tests did not usually become abnormal. In a previous investigation in the same type of patients, we studied the effects of mestranol (a synthetic 17-alkylated oestrogen) in a daily dose of 0.1 mg with the same dose-schedule as the present investigation and 17-beta-oestradiol appeared to impair liver function less than mestranol. It might thus be safer to use 17-beta-oestradiol as a therapeutic agent.",
      "Evaluation of in vivo parameters of drug metabolizing enzyme activity in man after administration of clemastine, phenobarbital or placebo. The 24 h urinary excretion of 6beta-hydroxycortisol and D-glucaric acid, the plasma half lives and total clearances of aminopyrine, and serum gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase activity have been measured in nineteen healthy male volunteers. The study was done double blind and was conducted as a test of induction of microsomal drug metabolizing enzymes during and after daily doses of 6 mg clemastine, 300 mg phenobarbital or a placebo. The urinary excretion of 6beta-hydroxycortisol and D-glucaric acid was significantly increased in the phenobarbital group, the standard for induction. No changes were observed after treatment with clemastine or placebo. Phenobarbital also reduced the half life of aminopyrine, but it was not affected by clemastine or placebo. Gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase activity increased only in the phenobarbital group. The elimination constant k2 of aminopyrine and the excretion of glucaric acid in the pre-medication period were correlated (p less than 0.05) The results indicate that the tests  were of diagnostic value in determination of microsomal enzyme induction by phenobarbital. Failure to observe similar changes after treatment with clemastine imply failure of induction of this activity under the experimental conditions.",

None of the treatments produced any marked signs of toxicity and no drug related deaths were observed. The full dose combination (3) did significantly reduce the weight compared to the control group (5). When urinary lactic dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase were measured, all treatments caused some increase in activity but those containing aspirin had the greatest effect. Urinary pH and osmolarity were not effected by the treatments. Complete pathological examination of the animals failed to detect any significant changes when compared to the controls. It is concluded that there is no evidence of a toxic interaction between aspirin and acetaminophen in the rat."

Possible neurotoxic actions of intracerebral injections of ibotenic acid, a conformationally restricted analogue of glutamic acid, have been evaluated in rat brain and compared with those of kainic acid. Light microscopical analysis revealed that ibotenic acid produced a marked disappearance of nerve cells in all areas studied, namely striatum, the hippocampal formation, substantia nigra and piriform cortex. Lesions in areas distant to the injection site were not seen. Axons of passage and nerve terminals of extrinsic origin did not seem to be damaged, since, e.g., no apparent degeneration of the dopaminergic terminals in the neostriatum was observed except for a small area surrounding the cannula. In the neostriatum, enkephalin immunoreactive neuronal cell bodies as well as nerve terminals disappeared after injection of ibotenic acid into this nucleus. After injection into the substantia nigra tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive cell bodies in the zona compacta disappeared, whereas no certain effect could be seen on the enkephalin immunoreactive nerve fibers. In vitro experiments, conducted with striatal synaptosomal and membrane preparations, showed that ibotenic acid differed from kainic acid by being devoid of a significant inhibitory effect on high affinity glutamate uptake and by having a low affinity for 3H-kainic acid binding sites. Furthermore, ibotenic acid did not interfere with the binding of a number of radioligands for other transmitter receptors. As compared to kainic acid, ibotenic acid has the advantage of being less toxic to the animals and of producing more discrete lesions, possibly due to faster metabolism and/or other fundamental biochemical differences. Because of these special features, ibotenic acid seems to represent a valuable new tool in the morphological and functional analysis of central neuronal systems.",
      "Prevention and treatment of space sickness in shuttle-orbiter missions. Today it is impossible accurately to predict susceptibility to space sickness of crew members making their first transition into orbit, for want of a ground-based validated model of free fall. Even assuming that space sickness is simply a specific designation for motion sickness that may be experienced in orbital flight (and here agreement is not general), preventive therapy poses difficult problems because, for a priori reasons, either all crew members or none should receive treatment. If all receive preventive therapy, everyone should execute head movements in a programmed manner to ensure rapid adaptation to the environment; at least a large minority will not benefit but rather will experience whatever sideeffects inevitably accompany administration of a drug. If none receive preventive therapy prelaunch, at least a large minority will pose two problems--treatment for acute motion sickness and rapid acquisition of adaptation. Trade-offs will involve the identification of long-acting antimotion sickness drugs for use prelaunch that will be efficacious for at least 90% of those going aloft for the first time and the effectiveness of combining rapid adaptation with treatment of motion sickness. The following report describes recent experiments dealing with these problems.",
      "Biliary excretion of iopanoate glucuronide by the rat. Biliary excretion, plasma decay, and tissue distribution of 125I after a single intravenous dose (13 mumol/kg)  of 125I-Iopanoate and 125I-iopanoate glucuronide were compared in control and phenobarbital-pretreated rats under either anesthesia. In control animals the plasma decay of iopanoate glucuronide following iopanoate glucuronide administration was significantly greater than that after iopanoate administration. Biliary clearance following iopanoate glucuronide was approximately 20 times greater than that after iopanoate; within 60 min, 82% of the dose of iopanoate glucuronide, compared to 23% of the dose of iopanoate, was recovered in bile. Phenobarbital pretreatment significantly increased the biliary excretion following iopanoate administration but had no effect on that following iopanoate glucuronide. The urinary excretion after both agents was less than 3% of the administered dose within the 60-min experimental period. The data suggest that intracellular metabolism and/or binding may account for the marked difference in the biliary excretion of iopanoate glucuronide following iopanoate as compared to that after administration of iopanoate glucuronide."

Several reports have suggested that cylcic guanosine 3'-5' monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic 3'-5' adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) are involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation. Following our previous reports on the cAMP system in human brain tumors, we decided to investigate the cGMP system in the same pathological tissues by studying the activity of guanylate cyclase and cGMP-phosphodiesterase (cGMP-PDE). We found that the activity of both enzymes is lower in neurinomas and glioblastomas than in meningiomas or in normal cerebral cortex. Furthermore, the subcellular distribution of guanylate cyclase in human cerebral cortex differs from that of neurinomas and glioblastomas. On the basis of such observations we have discussed the possibility that the regulatory mechanism of the enzymes related to the cyclic nucleotide metabolism is altered in brain tumors.",
      "Inhibition of nitroso chemical carcinogen activation of rat hepatic guanylate cyclase by anticancer agents. Recent studies have demonstrated that nitroso chemical carcinogens activate guanylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.2) which catalyzes the production of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate. This nucleotide is thought to be involved in normal and abnormal cell growth. We examined the effect of 3 major classes of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents, the antimetabolites (methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine), antitumor antibiotics (adriamycin and actinomycin D), and alkylating agents (cytoxan, uracil mustard, isophosphamide, chlornaphazine, and 1-propranol-3,3'-iminodimethane sulfonate) on the activation of guanylate cyclase by nitroso chemical carcinogens. The anticancer chemotherapeutic agents noncompetitively blocked the activation of rat hepatic guanylate cyclase by N'-nitro-N-nitroso-N-propylguanidine (NNPG) and hydrazine. Adriamycin, methotrexate, and uracil mustard were the most effective inhibitors completely abolishing the effect of 1 mM NNPG on guanylate cyclase activity. The remainder of the anticancer chemotherapeutic agents abolished the NNPG activation of guanylate cyclase 40--70%. Since a previously described guanylate cyclase inhibitor has been shown to terminate the growth of an undifferentiated prostatic cancer in tissue culture the present data may indicate that one of the mechanisms by which anticancer chemotherapeutic agents exert their effects is by inhibition of tumor guanylate cyclase activity.",
      "Guanylate cyclase and cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase activities and cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate levels in normal and transformed fibroblasts in culture. To investigate the role of guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in cultured cells we have measured guanylate cyclase and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activities and cyclic GMP levels in normal and transformed fibroblastic cells. Guanylate cyclase activity is found almost exclusively in the particulate fraction of normal rat kidney (NRK) and BALB 3T3 cells. Enzyme activity is stimulated 3- to 10-fold by treatment with the detergent Lubrol PX. However, enhancement of guanylate cyclase by fibroblast growth factor could not be demonstrated under a variety of assay conditions. In both NRK and BALB 3T3 cells guanylate cyclase activity is low during logarithmic growth and increases as the cells crowd together and growth slows. Guanylate cyclase activity is undetectable in homogenates of NRK cells transformed by the Kirsten sarcoma virus (KNRK cells) either in the presence or absence of Lubrol PX. Guanylate cyclase activity is also greatly decreased in NRK cells transformed by Moloney, Schmidt-Ruppin, or Harvey viruses. BALB 3T3 cells transformed by RNA viruses (Kirsten, Harvey, or Moloney), by a DNA virus (SV40), by methylcholanthrene, or spontaneously, all have diminished but readily detectable guanylate cyclase activity. Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity is found predominately in the soluble fraction of NRK cells. This activity increases slightly as NRK cells enter the stationary growth phase. Cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity is undetectable in two clones of KNRK cells under a variety of assay conditions, and is decreased relative to the level present in NRK cells in a third KNRK clone. However, both Moloney- and Schmidt-Ruppin-transformed NRK cells have a phosphodiesterase activity similar to that found in NRK cells. Boiled supernatant from both NRK and KNRK cells is observed to appreciably enhance the activity of activator-deficient phosphodiesterase from bovine heart. This result indicates that the absence of cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase activity in KNRK cells is not due to a loss of the phosphodiesterase activator. The intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP is found to be very low in transformed NRK cells when compared to levels measured in confluent NRK cells. The low levels of cyclic GMP in transformed NRK cells reflect the greatly decreased guanylate cyclase activity observed in these cells. These results do not appear to support the suggestion that cyclic GMP promotes the growth of fibroblastic cells."

In the Avy/a mice, body weight, liver weight and plasma insulin level increased steadily as the mice aged. In the a/a mice, the change of these three parameters was much slower. Plasma insulin concentration in a/a mice did not increase until eight months of age.

      "Study of urinary excretion of butobarbitone in man in relation to the percentage of ideal body weight. 1 Thirty-three patients with no evidence of endocrine disease, hepatic or renal insufficiency or sleep disorders, were classified in groups 1 to 4 in order of increasing of percentage of ideal body weight (IBW) respectively: less than 90% of IBW, 90--120%, 120--180%, and greater than 180% of IBW. After oral administration of 200 mg butobarbitone, concentration of the intact drug was measured by gas liquid chromatographic assay in urine samples collected during 72 h and at three times in blood. 2 A highly significant negative relationship was found between the cumulative excretion of butobarbitone with urine and the logarithm of the percentage of IBW. In contrast for a given weight, excretion of the drug with urine was found to be weakly correlated with the diuresis. 3 The cumulative urinary elimination of butobarbitone was significantly different between the groups studied, except of the difference between the group 2 and 3 of the patients. No significant difference was found between the renal clearances of butobarbitone in the four groups of subjects. 4 We conclude that redistribution of butobarbitone into adipose tissues can explain the obtained results and that obesity modifies the pharmacokinetics of the drug.",
      "Does hyperinsulinemia in ob/ob mice cause an insulin-stimulated adipose tissue? After a 1-h preincubation to remove endogenous insulin, adipose tissue of obese mice (C57BL/L4 ob/ob) had a lower rate of glucose metabolism than tissue which was not preincubated. In contrast, preincubation did not change the metabolism of adipose tissue from lean mice (C57B1/6J +/+). The preincubation effect was abolished in obese mice which had had their serum insulin levels lowered toward normal by streptozotocin treatment. Injection of anti-insulin serum to obese mice caused adipose tissue removed 15 min after the injection to display a rate of glucose metabolsim lower than that of tissue removed before the injection. No such effect was seen in lean mice. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that hyperinsulinemia in the obese mice causes a chronic state of insulin stimulation of their adipose tissue, possibly contributing to their high rates of lipogenesis and their obesity. Several lipogenic enzymes were measured in adipose tissue of both lean and obese mice, and no single enzymatic abnormality was detected which might explain the hyperlipogenesis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase were both insulin-sensitive enzymes in lean and obese mice."

The examination of the regulation of the system of 3'-5' cyclic nucleotide monophosphates has only begun in cancer tissues. In human cancers, these studies are notably non-existent. However, in animal cancers, especially the Morris hepatomas, enough data has been gathered that, while risky, certain trends seem to begin to appear. Cyclic AMP is constant or lowered, while cyclic GMP is elevated in the fast growing hepatomas. Regulation of adenylate cyclase by protein hormones is reduced, while regulation by epinephrine may be increased. Binding of glucagon is decreased in the fast growing hepatomas. Guanylate cyclase, while being predominantly cytoplasmic in the normal liver, is predominantly membrane bound in the tumors. The liver enzyme is also readily stimulated by several chemical carcinogens. The cyclic GMP phosphodiesterases are decreased in these tumors; while the cAMP phosphodiesterases are increased. Although the cyclic nucleotide dependent protein kinases (histone as substrate) are altered in the hepatomas, observations of unique cyclic nucleotide binding proteins or cAMP independent protein kinases in cancer tissues may be of even greater significance for the development of or the maintenance of the neoplastic state of cells.",

      "New approaches to the causation and prevention of cancers of epithelial surfaces. Environmental rather than genetic factors appear to be responsible for the causation of cancers involving epithelial surfaces, especially oropharyngeal cancers, cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract, cancers of the liver and gall-bladder, cancers of the cervix uteri and lung cancers. Epithelial surfaces which have mucus-bearing cells are particularly prone, because if these mucus cells are surrounded by an alkaline milieu over a prolonged period, the mucous of the epithelial cells is rendered fluid and is removed from the cells, of which it forms an integral part. This leads to proliferative changes with metaplasia, cell-atypia and a very significant increase in mitotic activity. Such changes are a prelude to carcinogenesis. In the case of many oropharyngeal cancers in Asia and Africa it is the alkaline slaked lime in the betel quid which is responsible; in the case of gastric cancers it is the reflux of the alkaline duodenal contents into the stomach; in the case of colon it is the absence of roughage, cellulose and vegetable fibres from the diet; in the case of the cervix uteri it is the frequency of coitus which gives rise to a highly alkaline seminal fluid; and in the case of cancer lung it is the alkaline cigarette smoke."

Neuraminidase treatment of the unadsorbed enzyme fraction did not significantly increased the proportion of enzyme activities that bound to the concanavalin A--Sepharose 4B. Characterization of acid beta-D-galactosidase from the adsorbed and unadsorbed enzyme fractions of mucolipidosis II and mucolipidosis III patients demonstrated identical apparent Km values of 0.22 mM with respect to 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-D-galactopyranoside, altered pH--activity profiles and heterogeneous isoelectric-focusing patterns.

      "Evidence for secretion of vasoactive intestinal peptide by tumours of pancreas, adrenal medulla, thyroid and lung: support for the unifying APUD concept. Levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were measured by radioimmunoassay in plasma or tissue from thirty-five patients with watery diarrhoea, and in plasma of twenty-five normal controls. Plasma levels were between 0.6 and 11.0 ng/ml in thirty-one of the thirty-three patients in whom it was measured and too low to measure (less than 200 pg/ml) in the other two. Peptide levels were less than 200 pg/ml in twenty-three of the controls, but higher in the remaining two. All tissues from patients were \"rich\" in VIP (10 ng to 35 microgram per g). The aetiologic diagnoses included pancreatic islet-cell adenoma or adenocarcinoma, islet-cell hyperplasia, bronchogenic carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, ganglioneuroblastoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and retroperitoneal histiocytoma. The findings support the conclusions that: (1) VIP is a likely mediator of the water-diarrhoea syndrome; (2) the syndrome may result from a variety of tumours; (3) this or a related peptide hormone may be secreted by these tumours; and (4) these tumours may have a common embryonic origin.",

The main pancreatic duct in cats possesses a relatively strong barrier to the diffusion of bicarbonate ions (HCO3-). We studied some of the characteristics of this barrier by perfusing the duct with a solution similar in composition to pancreatic juice before and after exposing the duct mucosa to various test agents. The difference in net flux of HCO3- across the duct before and after exposure to the test agent reflected damage to the barrier. The barrier was damaged by infected bile, aspirin (pH 2.3), hydrochloric acid (pH 2.3), ethanol (5 to 10 per cent), and secondary bile acids. It was not damged by sterile bile, aspirin (pH 6.5), and primary bile acids. These data indicate that the barrier to back diffusion in the pancreatic duct has unique properties, different in some respects from the properties of the gastric mucosal barrier. Furthermore, the barrier is vulnerable to some agents thought possibly to have a role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.",

The pH of the pancreatic tissue changed differently in the different groups, in accordance with the different pathomechanisms. Injection of sunflower oil was followed by a protracted acidosis of pancreatic tissue, that of taurocholate by a transitory moderate decline of pH. Egg-yolk produced an evanescent, slight fall in pancreatic pH, followed by complete normalization within a few minutes. The differences between the initial and the 3-h values attain the level of significance only in case of sunflower-oil pancreatitis."

III. Comparative studies on biotransformation of exogenous and endogenous lysozyme in rats. Exogenous hen lysozyme or endogenous rat lysozyme labeled with 131I was intravenously injected to rats with the same dosage, respectively, and the uptake and degradation of injected 131I-labeled rat lysozyme in liver and kidney were studied in comparison with those of 131I-labeled hen lysozyme. 1. Although the serum levels of both enzymes injected were almost indentical during the first 6 h, the liver uptake of 131I-labeled hen lysozyme was 2.2-fold more than that of 131I-labeled rat lysozyme at the peak time of 5 min after injection. The uptake and clearance of 131I-labeled rat lysozyme in the kidney were exclusively slow as compared with those of 131I-labeled hen lysozyme. 2. The intracellular distribution in the liver and kidney were examined by the differential centrifugation after injection of each lysozyme. The protein-bound radioactivity of each subcellular fraction was found to be the highest in the 12 000 X g (10 min) fraction in the liver and the 19 600 X g (20 min) fraction in the kidney. The relative specific activity of 12 000 X g fraction of the liver after injection increased with the time lapse. On the other hand, the relative specific activity of 105 000 X g (1 h) fraction of the liver attained a maximum within 5 min after injection and thereafter decreased. It was assumed that the mechanism of the uptake of injected 131I-labeled rat lysozyme in the liver and kidney was similar to that of 131I-labeled hen lysozyme. 3. The degradation of exogenous or endogenous lysozyme in subcellular particles was examined. From the effect of pH, activator and inhibitor on the degradation, the proteolytic enzyme to degrade the injected 131I-labeled hen lysozyme was indicated to be mainly cathepsin BL, with the optimal pH of about 5.0, and the injected 131I-labeled rate lysozyme was mainly degraded by cathepsin D, with the optimal pH of about 3.5 The in vitro degradation of exogenous and endogenous lysozymes showed a tendency similar to the in vivo clearance from the liver and kidney.",

Lysozyme from eggs of the Dipterous Ceratitis capitata (Wiedeman) has been purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration and its physicochemical properties have been investigated. This is the first insect lysozyme characterized so far and it exhibits some properties different to those described for other animal lysozymes. 2. Lysozyme from the insect eggs has a molecular weight of about 23200 and a sedimentation coefficient of 2.4 S. Molecular weight determination by sodium dedecylsulphate gel electrophoresis indicates that the molecule consists of a single polypeptide chain. 3. This lysozyme preparation shows notable stability at acidic pH values and lability at alkline pH values. It shows a single optimum pH at about 6.5.4. Chitinase/muramidase specific activity ratio is around 350 times higher for the insect lysozyme than for the hen egg-white enzyme. 5. The amino-acid composition shows the presence of one tryptophan residue per molecule of enzyme. This fact differentiates the lysozyme from insect eggs from other animal and plant lysozymes.

Selective photooxidation of the methionyl residues in lysozyme was achieved after 26 h of reaction in 84% acetic acid at 4 degrees C. The specific activity of lysozyme exposed to light in the presence of methylene blue decreased by 94%, while that of a lysozyme solution in the presence of methylene blue not exposed to light decreased by 21%. The lysozyme solution exposed to light but not containing the methylene blue beads lost 33% of its specific activity after the same period of photooxidation. It was shown that the decrease in enzyme activity was not caused by adsorption of the enzyme onto the beads."

      "Variable content of histaminase, L-dopa decarboxylase and calcitonin in small-cell carcinoma of the lung. Biologic and clinical implications. To ascertain whether the content of endocrine markers is constant in small-cell carcinoma of the lung, levels of three markers of medullary thyroid carcinoma were studied in this tumor. Histaminase was increased in six of six primary tumors (three to 14,000 times), L-dopa decarboxylase in four of six (six to 30 times), and calcitonin in one of one (eight times) over levels in adjacent lung. Marker levels in mediastinal metastases reflected those in primary tumors in four of five patients. However, in four of seven, multiple hepatic metastases contained low to absent levels despite simultaneously high values in chest lesions. Immunohistochemical studies of histaminase revealed that within each primary tumor different cells contained different amounts of the enzyme. Since marker content varied between tumor cells, between primary tumors and between metastases in individual patients we conclude that circulating levels of these three markers cannot be expected necessarily to mirror tumor burden in patients with small-cell lung tumors.",

In ovarian cancer, only CEA and PLAP levels appeared to reflect tumor burden and were complementary in detecting active disease. In cervical cancer, CEA and GGT reflected tumor burden, while PLAP showed just the reverse--the highest degree of positivity being present in minimal disease. PLAP positivity was even more pronounced in patients with cervical dysplasia and carcinoma in situ while CEA and GGT were negative. The data indicate that the use of marker combinations can improve our capacity to detect minimal disease and provide information regarding tumor biology that may not be available by studying individual markers or by other means. It remains to be determined whether the use of tumor markers can influence existing therapy sufficiently to alter the outcome in cancers which are notoriously difficult to treat."

The clinical picture of metabolic encephalopathies has no aetiological specificity. It combines disturbances in conscious level dominated by disorientation and time and space and disturbances in motor activity, in particular tremor and asterixis. For each of the aetiologies studied, the following are considered: the circumstances of onset, the clinical and laboratory picture, the physiopathology and the treatment. From a diagnostic standpoint, particular emphasis should be placed upon the circumstances of onset which alone give any indication. The majority of these encephalopathies are caused by a lack of respect for simple rules in parenteral alimentation or by deficiencies. It is thus essentially an iatrogenic pathology. Treatment should be above all preventive.",
      "Brain monoamines in hepatic encephalopathy and other types of metabolic coma. Tyrosine (Tyr), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), tryptophan (Trp), serotonin (5-HT), and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) were assayed spectrofluorometrically and radioenzymatically in various regions of post-mortem brains of human patients with hepatic, uremic, and diabetic coma, liver cirrhosis without coma, and hepatic coma treated with parenteral administration of L-valine, a branched-chain amino acid. The results were as follows: In both hepatic and diabetic coma Tyr was increased as compared to non-comatose cirrhosis and controls, while TH acitivity was within normal limits, indicating sufficient oxygen supply of the brain in both types of coma. Brain DA showed a mild decrease in all types of metabolic coma. Brain Trp was not considerably changed in non-comatose cases of liver cirrhosis and after L-valine treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, but was significantly increased in hepatic coma, with highest elevation in the brainstem tegmentum. Both 5-HT and 5-HIAA were not significantly changed in non-comatose cirrhosis, while a general increase with prevalence for the brainstem was obvious in all types of metabolic coma. After L-valine treatment of hepatic coma, 5-HT levels were usually decreased below control values, while 5-HIAA levels were at or below controls. These results in human post-mortem brains confirm previous CSF and brain findings in experimental and human hepatic and uremic encephalopathies, indicating derangement of brain monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism which is attributed to imbalance of aromatic and branched-chain amino acids in plasma and brain. Increased cerebral 5-HT turnover, particularly in the ascending serotonergic brainstem systems, due to derangement of brain uptake of Trp is suggested to represent an important biochemical substrate of disorders of consciousness in hepatic failure and other types of metabolic encephalopathies. Clinical improvement of hepatic encephalopathy and of the underlying neurotransmitter derangements by administration of L-valine and the possible role of this competitive amino acid on intermediary metabolism and ammonia detoxification are discussed.",
      "[Amino acid disturbances in liver failure]. We have attempted to trace the development of the concept which stresses that the encephalopathy often seen with hepatic failure may be the result of derangement in amino acid metabolism in patients with failing livers. We have also proposed that the infusion of solutions which may normalize these plasma amino acids and decrease the amount of toxic aromatic amino acids within the circulation may help in the amelioration of the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. We believe that in our studies to date, the use of this solution has been a significant advantage in the care of these extremely ill patients. We would hope that when the solution becomes generally available, the provision of such solutions to such patients will result in the salvage of some lives lost at the present time because of hepatic failure and encephalopathy."

Sequence analysis of 5'-[32P] labeled tRNA and eukaryotic mRNA using an adaptation of a method recently described by Donis-Keller, Maxam and Gilbert for mapping guanines, adenines and pyrimidines from the 5'-end of an RNA is described. In addition, a technique utilizing two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for identification of pyrimidines within a sequence is described. 5'-[32P] Labeled rabbit beta-globin mRNA and N. crassa mitochondrial initiator tRNA were partially digested with T1- RNase for cleavage at G residues, with U2-RNase for cleavage at A residues, with an extracellular RNase from B. cereus for cleavage at pyrimidine residues and with T2-RNase or with alkali for cleavage at all four residues. The 5'-[32P] labeled partial digestion products were separated according to their size, by electrophoresis in adjacent lanes of a polyacrylamide slab gel and the location of G's, A's and of pyrimidines extending 60-80 nucleotides from the 5'-end of the RNA determined. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to separate the 5'-[32P] labeled fragments present in partial alkali digests of a 5'-[32P] labeled mRNA. The mobility shifts corresponding to the difference of a C residue were distinct from those corresponding to a U residue and this formed the basis of a method for distinguishing between the pyrimidines.",
      "A specific dimerization of rabbit beta-globin messenger ribonucleic acid. Rabbit globin mRNA, when layered in low salt on 0.1 M-NaCl/sucrose gradients, separates into two peaks of material. Translation of these two RNA fractions in the wheat-germ cell-free system, hybridization against globin complementary DNA (cDNA) and cross-hybridization against cDNA species prepared from each fraction show that the first peak sedimenting at 10S is a alpha-globin mRNA and the second peak, sedimenting at approx. 15S, is beta-globin mRNA. The sedimentation rate of the beta-globin mRNA is concentration-dependent. By changing concentration and pH, it is indicated that in low-salt beta-globin mRNA adopts a conformation that leads to specific, but weak, self-dimerization during centrifugation in 0.1M-NaCl. This property permits rapid preparation of intact and relatively pure alpha- and beta-globin mRNA species.",

The suppression mechanism of glutamine synthetase [EC 6.3.1.2] induction mediated by chick interferon preparation was investigated in embryonic chick neural retina cell cultures. A translational assay was used to measure the level of mRNA coding for the enzyme. RNA extracted from the retinal polysomes was chromatographed on oligo(dT)-cellulose and translated in a cell-free protein synthesizing system derived from wheat germ. The newly synthesized enzyme was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-enzyme gamma-globulin and identified using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Neither polysomal profiles nor total protein synthesis directed by the RNA preparations was affected by interferon treatment. Comparing the amount of glutamine synthetase synthesized in vitro by equal amounts of mRNA fraction from retinas treated with or without interferon indicated that the suppression was associated with reduced level of the enzyme mRNA on polysomes."

Metabolic rates and intercellular transfer of metabolites were studied in human glia and glioma culture cells via topographic scan of NAD(P)H fluorescence by multichannel microfluorometry in conjunction with microinjection of glucose-6-P + allosteric activators. Metabolic rates evaluated from NAD(P) in equilibrium NAD(P)H transients and the required substrate levels were 3--4 times lower in glioma  cells as compared to glia cells. Both glia and glioma cells showed variability in the occurrence of intercellular metabolite transfer, detectable via observation of a transient in a neighbour of the cell injected with substrate. On this basis \"multicellular integrated states\" can be defined in clusters of glioma and glia cells interconnected by cell-to-cell contact and a mesh-like network of intercellular processes. Such multicellular steady states and the associated metabolic rates or their impairment can be used in turn to classify different culture lines in reference to cell physiology and pathology.",
      "Transient inhibition of cell proliferation in rat glioma monolayer cultures by cortisol. The effect of 3 muM cortisol on cell proliferation in rat glioma (strain C6) monolayer cultures was investigated. Cell density measurements showed that cortisol-treated C6 cells continued to proliferate at maximum log phase rates for 1 to 2 days. Then cell proliferation ceased as growth in control cultures continued into stationary phase. A 2-day period of growth inhibition followed during which cell densities were 30 to 50% lower relative to controls. Growth resumed subsequently, and final cell densities were similar to those of controls. The presence of epicortisol (the biologically inactive isomer of cortisol) in the culture medium did not alter the rate of log phase growth relative to controls. During the initial period of continued growth after exposure to cortisol, the pH of the medium decreased at the same rate in control and treated cultures. During the growth-inhibitory period, erythrosin B dye was excluded equally well (greater than 94%) by control and treated cells, and no morphological differences were detected by phase contrast microscopy. When the culture medium was replaced daily, the control cells at elevated densities continued to proliferate at a reduced rate. In cortisol-treated cultures, the period of growth inhibition commenced 3 days after the cells were exposed initially to cortisol. A 2-day period of growth inhibition followed during which the pH of the 1-day-old media from both control and treated cultures decreased from 7.4 to 6.9. Growth resumed subsequently in the treated cultures to produce elevated cell densities similar to those of controls. These results demonstrate that cortisol at concentrations considered chemotherapeutic in vivo exerts a transient inhibitory effect on C6 glioma cell proliferation.",
      "Comparison of the substrate specificity of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate- and guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinases. Kinetic studies using synthetic peptides corresponding to phosphorylation sites in histone H2B. The substrate specificities of cyclic GMP-dependent and cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases have been compared by kinetic analysis using synthetic peptides as substrates. Both enzymes catalyzed the transfer of phosphate from ATP to calf thymus histone H2B, as well as to two synthetic peptides, Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser32-Arg-Lys-Glu and Arg-Lys-Glu-Ser36-Tyr-Ser-Val, corresponding to the amino acid sequences around serine 32 and serine 36 in histone H2B. Serine 38 in the latter peptide was not phosphorylated by either enzyme. Cyclic GMP-dependent kinase  and cyclic AMP-dependent kinase catalyzed the incorporation of 1.1 and 2.0 mol of phosphate/mol of histone H2B, respectively. The phosphorylation of histone H2B, respectively. The phosphorylation of histone H2B by cyclic GMP-dependent kinase showed two distinct optima as the magnesium concentration was increased. However, the phosphorylation of either synthetic peptide by this enzyme was depressed at high magnesium concentrations. As the pH of reaction mixtures was elevated from pH 6 to pH 9, the rate of phosphorylation of Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser32-Arg-Lys-Glu by cyclic GMP-dependent kinase continually increased. Acetylation of the NH2 terminus of the peptide did not qualitatively affect this pH profile, but did increase the Vmax value of the enzyme 3-fold. The apparent Km and Vmax values for the phosphorylation of Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser32-Arg-Lys-Glu by cyclic GMP-dependent kinase were 21 microM and 4.4 mumol/min/mg, respectively. The synthetic peptide Arg-Lys-Glu-Ser36-Tyr-Ser-Val was a relatively poor substrate for cyclic GMP-dependent kinase, exhibiting a Km value of 732 microM, although the Vmax was 12 micromol/min/mg. With histone H2B as substrate for the cyclic GMP-dependent kinase, two different Km values were apparent. The Km values for cyclic AMP-dependent kinase for either synthetic peptide were approximately 100 microM, but the Vmax for Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser32-Arg-Lys-Glu was 1.1 mumol/min/mg, while the Vmax for Arg-Lys-Glu-Ser36-Tyr-Ser-Val was 16.5 mumol/min/mg. These data suggest that although the two cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinases have similar substrate specificities, the determinants dictated by the primary sequence around the two phosphorylation sites in histone H2B are different for the two enzymes."

III. Correlation of the regulatory kinetic and molecular properties of the rabbit muscle enzyme. It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation.",

Transduction with phage P1 indicates at least 70% linkage between glnA and polA. The order of the pfk and tpi markers is reversed from that previously published. Despite the relatively large distance separating the glnA and rha loci, deletions removing this entire region have no obvious phenotype.

      "A fluorescamine-based sensitive method for the assay of proteinases, capable of detecting the initial cleavage steps of a protein. The properties of the reaction of fluorescamine with proteins are the basis for the development of a sensitive, general and simple method for the assay of proteolytic activities. More importantly, the assay measures the initial step(s) of proteolytic attack, making it specially suitable for the examination of the controlling factors that regulate proteolytic degradation and/or the detection of 'specific' proteinases. The method allows the simple determination of the general parameters of enzyme action, V and Km, using proteins, i.e. the physiological substrates of the proteinases. The more appropriate proteins to be used as substrates are the N-amino-terminally blocked ones. Many proteins fulfill this requirement. If the particular protein whose degradation has to be studied lacks this modification, three different approaches can be used to study its degradation: (a) the accumulation of N-amino termini in excess over that of the intact substrate; (b) a gel filtration/continuous method and (c) the chemical blockage of its amino groups. The particular advantages of each of these approaches are discussed."

Mean insulin concentration in solitary adenomas and in adenomas of patients with adenomatosis was higher than in control pancreases; however, in all but 1 patient the insulin concentration in neoplastic islet tissue was lower than in islet tissue of control pancreas, assuming islet volume is 1% of pancreas. The percentage of proinsulin was elevated in 52% of tumors. Adenoma insulin content correlated with increments of plasma insulin after tolbutamide administration. Insulin and proinsulin concentrations in pancreas uninvolved by tumor were not suppressed. Fasting plasma glucagon was elevated in patients with islet cell adenomatosis and in patients with islet cell carcinoma some of whom had multiple endocrine adenomatosis. The mean concentration of glucagon in tumors was lower than in control pancreases. Elevated concentration of gastrin was found in some adenomas. The data indicate: 1) insulin-secreting islet cell tumors have decreased storage capacity for insulin, 2) elevated concentration of proinsulin in tumors may be due to decreased capacity to store insulin and in some to decreased conversion of proinsulin to insulin as well, 3) tolbutamide stimulates the exaggerated release of a relatively constant fraction of insulin stored in adenomas. 4) solitary adenomas may contain excess amounts of pancreatic hormones in addition to insulin, 5) elevated plasma glucagon in patients with organic hyperinsulinism may indicate malignancy, microadenomatosis or multiple endocrine adenoma syndrome, and 6) chronic hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia due to adenoma do not suppress insulin and proinsulin content of uninvolved pancreas.",
      "The pancreatic duct mucosal barrier. The main pancreatic duct in cats possesses a relatively strong barrier to the diffusion of bicarbonate ions (HCO3-).

The difference in net flux of HCO3- across the duct before and after exposure to the test agent reflected damage to the barrier. The barrier was damaged by infected bile, aspirin (pH 2.3), hydrochloric acid (pH 2.3), ethanol (5 to 10 per cent), and secondary bile acids. It was not damged by sterile bile, aspirin (pH 6.5), and primary bile acids.

By 28 days most of these parameters of drug metabolism had returned to control levels. Lung hydroxyproline concentration, an index of collagen, did not differ in pneumonectomized and control animals at any of the time points. 3-Methylcholanthrene failed to induce the pulmonary mono-oxygenase system in pneumonectomized animals. The response of pulmonary drug-metabolizing enzymes to unilateral pneumonectomy in rabbits was temporally and qualitatively similar to the response in rat liver following partial hepatectomy.",

      "Lung pH and pulmonary absorption of nonvolatile drugs in the rat. The effect of pH on pulmonary absorption of nonvolatile drugs was investigated in the rat. Krebs-Ringer phosphate solutions (pH 6.2 and 7.4), Krebs-Ringer pyrophosphate solution (pH 8.4), or an unbuffered salt solution containing a drug were administered through tight-fitting tracheal cannulas to anesthetized animals. After 3 min, the lungs were removed and assayed for the amount of drug that remained. Weak acids and a weak base were absorbed most rapidly at pH values at which the drugs were least ionized. For example, with the base procainamide, 36% of the dose was absorbed at pH 6.2 and 76% at pH 8.4. With the acid sulfisoxazole, 71% was absorbed at pH 6.2 and 55% at pH 8.4. Similarly, with p-aminosalicylic acid, 77% was absorbed at pH 6.2 and 40% at pH 8.4. In contrast to these results, compounds such as urea and amitrole, which remain completely nonionized over the pH range studied, showed no change in absorption rate when the pH was varied. The two weak acids and the weak base were absorbed from an unbuffered solution as though the pH at the site of drug absorption was between 6.2 and 7.4. The absorption rate for each weak electrolyte from unbuffered solution, when compared graphically with the respective absorption rates from buffered solutions, indicated that the pH at the site of drug absorption is about 6.6."

      "Activity of spectinomycin against anaerobes. The in vitro inhibitory activity of spectinomycin was tested against various anaerobic bacteria. Different results were obtained with different media and with different initial pH's of the media. The highest minimum inhibitory concentrations for Bacteroides fragilis ([Formula: see text] 128 mug/ml) were obtained with the use of Wilkins-Chalgren agar (pH 7.2) and Brucella blood agar (pH 7.0). Brucella blood agar at higher pH's (7.4 and 8.0) and Mueller-Hinton and Diagnostic Sensitivity Test agars produced lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (32 and 64 mug/ml). This same relationship between spectinomycin activity and pH of the medium was, in general, observed with these media and other anaerobes, including isolates of B. melaninogenicus, Fusobacterium, gram-positive cocci, Clostridium perfringens, and C. ramosum. The variable results observed in this study and in two others make it difficult to predict the clinical usefulness of spectinomycin in the treatment of anaerobic infections. It is probably most appropriate to be guided by results obtained with Wilkins-Chalgren agar and the method proposed as a reference to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. These results indicate that spectinomycin is not a potent inhibitor of B. fragilis or other clinically significant anaerobes.",
      "Characterization of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli by using rapid slide tests for beta-lactamase production. A total of 175 isolates of anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were tested for beta-lactamase production by using a slide test modification of the chromogenic cephalosporin (Nitrocefin, Glaxo, Middlesex, England) assay and the iodometric slide test. Included isolates were Bacteroides melaninogenicus (46), B. fragilis (78), other Bacteroides isolates (21), Fusobacterium (25), and other gram-negative bacilli (5). Both slide tests detected 25 B. melaninogenicus isolates that were beta-lactamase producers (minimal inhibitory concentration of penicillin was greater than 0.78 micrograms/ml). beta-Lactamase produced by the other gram-negative anaerobes could only be detected by the Nitrocefin assay. This assay was positive in 70 or 77 B. fragilis against which the minimal inhibitory concentration of penicillin was greater than 0.78 micrograms/ml. Ten of 11 other species of Bacteroides against which the minimal inhibitory concentration of penicillin was greater than 0.78 micrograms/ml were also Nitrocefin test positive. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin against all isolates of Fusobacterium and unidentifified gram-negative bacilli were less than or equal to 0.78 micrograms/ml and were Nitrocefin assay negative. beta-Lactamase-producing strains of B. melaninogenicus can be differentiated because both the slide iodometric and Nitrocefin assays will be positive, whereas beta-lactamase produced by other Bacteroides will only be detected by the Nitrocefin assay. Such penicillin-resistant isolates could be detected and reported to clinicians before final identification."

In the cytoplasm of well-spread cultured normal fibroblasts, actin is organized into a network of cables that run the length of the cell just inside the adherent cell membrane.

We have found a similar disruption in actin organization in cultured skin fibroblasts (passage 6-10) obtained by biopsy from patients with the inherited colonic cancer, adenomatosis of the colon and rectum (ACR). Because ACR is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, about half the children of ACR patients will develop colon cancer, but they typically remain asymptomatic until at least the second decade of life. Actin distribution within cultured cells from children of ACR patients was identical either to that seen in cultured cells from normal persons or to that seen in cultured cells from ACR patients. The two different patterns were independent of age, sex, drug treatment, or infections of the donors. Apparently, this class of colonic carcinoma is accompanied by a systemic aberration in the organization of fibroblast cytoplasm, and this aberration can be detected by immunofluorescent localization of actin within cultured skin fibroblasts, prior to manifestation of any colonic symptoms.",

      "Modified 5'-nucleotides resistant to 5'-nucleotidase: isolation of 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl) uridine 5'-phosphate and N2, N2-dimethylguanosine 5'-phosphate from snake venom hydrolysates of transfer RNA. A procedure for the quantitative measurement of the O2'-methylnucleoside constitutents of RNA has recently been developed in this laboratory (Gray, M.W. Can. J. Biochem. 53, 735-746 (1975)). This assay method is based on the resistance of O2'-methylnucleoside 5'-phosphates (pNm) (generated by phosphodiesterase hydrolysis of RNA) to subsequent dephosphorylation by venom 5'-nucleotidase (EC 3.1.3.5). In the present investigation, two base-modified 5'-nucleotides, each displaying an unusual resistance to 5'-nucleotidase, have been identified. These compounds have been characterized by a variety of techniques as N2, N2-dimethylguanosine 5'-phosphate (pm2/2G) and 3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)uridine 5'-phosphate (p4abu3U). Because of their resistance to 5'-nucleotidase, pm2/2G and p4abu3U are isolated along with the pNm in the mononucleotide fraction of venom hydrolysates of transfer RNA. Under hydrolysis conditions, the stability of p4abu3U is comparable to that of a pNm, allowing quantitative assay of the nucleotide. The proportion (mean +/- SD) of p4abu3U in venom hydrolysates of wheat embryo and Escherichia coli tRNA has been determined to be 0.35 +/- 0.03 (n=5) and 0.14 +/- 0.02 (n=4) mol%, respectively. The absence of p4abu3U in venom hydrolysates of yeast tRNA implies the absence of the corresponding nucleoside in yeast tRNA, in agreement with existing data. The variable recovery of pm2/2G from venom hydrolysates of wheat embryo and yeast tRNA indicates that under hydrolysis conditions, this base-modified nucleotide is only partially resistent to 5'-nucleotidase. The complete absence of pm2/2G in venom hydrolysates of E. coli tRNA is consistent with the known absence of N2, N2-dimethylguanosine in this RNA. These observations demonstrate that resistance to 5'-nucleotidase is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for concluding that a 5'-nucleotide is O2'-methylated. When applied to wheat embryo ribosomal RNA, the analytical methods described in this report failed to reveal any compound having the distinctive charge properties of p4abu3U. It therefore appears that 1-methyl-3-(3-amino-3-carboxypropyl)pseudouridine, recently characterized as a constituent of the 18 S rRNA of Chinese hamster cells (Saponara, A.G. &amp; Enger, M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta 349, 61-77 (1974)), may not be present in wheat embryo ribosomal RNA.",

This modification prevents EcoRI endonuclease activity, and thus is presumably at or near the EcoRI sequences (5') NAATTN.",
      "Increased and decreased sensitivity to carbon catabolite repression of enzymes of acetate metabolism in mutants of Aspergillus nidulans. The creA204, creB15 and creC27 mutations have been shown to cause carbon catabolite derepression of acetly CoA synthase and isocitrate lyase in Aspergillus nidulans. A recessive mutation, cre-34, which is linked to the creC gene, results in these enzymes being more sensitive than cre or wildtype strains to catabolite repression. The acetamidase levels of strains containing cre mutations have been investigated and provide support for the hypothesis that an acetate metabolite, rather than acetamide, induces this enzyme.",
      "Kinetic analysis of the individual reductive steps catalyzed by beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase obtained from yeast. The mechanism of action of yeast beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase has been investigated through kinetic studies on the oxidation of mevaldate by nicotinamide adeninine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) in the presence of coenzyme A (CoA) and on the reduction of mevaldate by reduced NADP (NADPH) in the absence of presence of CoA or acetyl-CoA. NADP and mevalonate were also used as product inhibitors of the reduction of mevaldate. In the reduction of mevaldate to mevalonate, coenzyme A and acetyl-CoA decreased the Km for mevaldate 30- and 3-fold, respectively. Both compounds increased the Vmax 1.5-fold. These results suggest that CoA is an allosteric activator for the second reductive step and that it acts by enhancing the binding of mevaldate. The intersecting patterns obtained from initial velocities and the patterns produced by product inhibitions suggest the following features of the mechanism. The binding of substrates and release of products proceeds sequentially in both reductive steps, and is ordered throughout or random with respect to the binding of the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA and the first NADPH. The binding of NADPH enhances the binding of the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl portion of the CoA ester and the binding of free mevaldate, whereas the binding of NADP leads to an increased affinity of the enzyme for the hemithioacetal (of mevaldate and CoA) and for mevalonate. Thus, the replacement of NADP by NADPH after the first reductive step promotes the conversion of the hemithioacetal to the free carbonyl form, which is then rapidly reduced. The products, CoA and mevalonic acid, of the second reductive step leave the enzyme before the release of the second NADP. This release of the last product is probably the rate-limiting step for the overall process."

At physiological pH, the melanostatin molecule is N-protonated in aqueous solution. The concentration dependences of the chemical shifts of amide-proton and carbonyl-carbon resonances and of proton spin-lattice relaxation times were observed in relation to molecular aggregations. In dimethylsulfoxide solution, aggregations were observed for N-protonated melanostatin and Pro-Leu-Gly prepared with HCl and for the Na salt of Z-Pro-Leu-Gly but not for N-protonated melanostatin prepared with HClO4 or HNO3, unprotonated melanostatin, Z-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2, or Z-Pro-Leu-Gly-OCH3. The leucine NH and glycine CO groups of N-protonated melanostatin are involved in the intermolecular hydrogen bonds of aggregates. The leucine NH group of N-protonated Pro-Leu-Gly also forms the intermolecular hydrogen bond. The solvent and temperature dependences of the chemical shifts of amide-proton and carbonyl-carbon resonances were measured to determine intramolecular hydrogen bonding. In dimethylsulfoxide solution, N-protonated melanostatin molecules in part take the beta-turn structure and the trans carboxamide NH proton and carbonyl oxygen of the proline residue form an intramolecular hydrogen bond.",
      "Effect of reagent pH on determination of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by precipitation with sodium phosphotungstate-magnesium. When determining high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by use of sodium phosphotungstate-magnesium precipitation method, I found that the pH of the sodium phosphotungstate reagent was a critical factor in the method. Unless the pH of the reagent was less than 7.6, the precipitation of low-density lipoprotein and very-low-density lipoprotein was incomplete. When the specimen pH was between 7.35 and 8.65, the pH of the serum of plasma did not influence the completeness of precipitation. Optimum concentrations of precipitation reagents, determined after the pH of the sodium phosphotungstate reagent was standardized to pH 6. 15, were 40 g/L for sodium phosphotungstate and 2 mol/L for MgCl2. The distribution of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in a healthy adult population was skewed to the left for women (n = 34; mean = 660 mg/L) and bi-modal for men (n = 44; mean = 460 mg/mL). The central 95% reference interval was 280 to 880 mg/L for women and 250 to 750 mg/L for men.",
      "Control of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase by endogenously synthesized sterols in vitro and in vivo. Isolated rat hepatocytes converted mevalonolactone into sterol intermediates and fatty acids 6- to 8-fold faster than mevalonate salt at concentrations less than 6 X 10(-4) M. Incubation of hepatocytes for 3 h normally results in induction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. This increase in enzyme activity was inhibited by mevalonolactone and by mevalonate salt; at each concentration between 6 X 10(-4) M and 6 X 10(-8) M the lactone was a more effective inhibitor than the salt. The increase in enzyme activity was completely prevented by 6 X 10(-4) M lactone, and at this concentration the cells synthesized from the lactone an amount of sterol per hour which approximated that leavingthe cells in the same period. Administration of mevalonolactone to intact rats resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity. At the highest dose (400 mg of (RS)-mevalonolactone/200 g of rat) enzyme activities declined 85% within 45 min and were still suppressed below normals after 28 h. Mevalonolactone treatment resulted in increases in liver cholesterol content and in the cholesterol ester concentration of liver microsomes. The results demonstrate that the activity of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase can be controlled by the rate of endogenous sterol synthesis both in vitro and in vivo."

The nature of riboflavin precursors was studied in the yeast Pichia guilliermondii. By means of mutants with blocked GMP-synthetase the purine precursors of riboflavin were shown to belong to guanylic compounds. Accumulation of 2,4,5-triamino-6-oxypyrimidine, 2,5-diamino-6-oxy-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine, 2,6-dioxy-5-amino-4-ribitylaminopyrimidine (DOARAP) and 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumasine occurs in the riboflavin-deficient mutants divided into five biochemical groups. This fact evidences for identity of riboflavin precursors in the yeast P. guilliermondii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthesis of DOARAP by the washed off cells of the mutants with the blocked lumasine synthetase is strongly inhibited by riboflavin; cycloheximide in the absence of riboflavin has no effect on this process. Consequently, flavinogenesis in P. guilliermondii is regulated according to the type of negative feedback by means of retroinhibition mechanism. A change in the content of flavins in the cells has no effect on synthesis of riboflavin synthetase; at the same time iron deficiency in the cells evokes derepression of this enzyme. Incubation of the cells rich in iron with o-phenantroline or alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl also causes derepression of riboflavin synthetase which is inhibited by cycloheximide. A deficiency of hem in the mutants which need epsilon-aminolevulinic acid does not affect the riboflavinsynthetase activity of the cells. Evidently, in P. guilliermondii a certain form of nonheminic iron might take part in regulating synthesis of riboflavin synthetase and other enzymes participating in riboflavin biosynthesis. Riboflavin overproduction is established to require formation of purines de novo. With the absence of flavinogenesis enzymes derepression a genetic disturbance in regulation of purinic nucleotides biosynthesis results in stimulation of flavinogenesis. The properties were studied for 680 time purified riboflavinkinase from cells of P. guilliermondii as well as for three phosphatases possessing the optimum of the activity at pH 3.5, 5.5 and 8.6, which ARE ABLE OF HYDROLYSING FMN. A change in the content of flavins and iron in the cells has no effect on the activity of riboflavinkinase in this species. Evidently, the mechanisms of riboflavin and flavin nucleotides biosynthesis regulation would be different in P. guilliermondii.",

A medical-legal opinion in 1962 found no relationship between vaccination and deafness. However, when subsequent judgement appeal was made, the legality of the initial decision had to be justified. The consequence of the case, supported by available publication, indicated that a close temporal probability between vaccination and postvaccinial cerebral complication was required to justify any further legal claim. This was not considered to be a factor in the present case since the discovery of a goitre in the patient in association with an iodine dysfunction uncovered a Pendred's syndrome as the cause for the patient's hearing loss.",

We determined the incidence of apnea, respiratory minute volume, alveolar gases, arterial gases and pH, \"specific\" compliance, functional residual capacity, and work of breathing. Theophylline decreased the incidence of apnea (P less than .05), increased respiratory minute volume (P less than 0.001), decreased (PACO2 (and PaCO2 P less than 0.001), increased the slope of the CO2 response curve (P less than 0.02) with a significant shift to the left (P less than 0.02).

The rate of hydrolysis of purine nucleotides in the nonmetastasizing tumor was two times higher than in the metastasizing tumor, but the rate of pyrimidine nucleotide hydrolysis was equal in both tumors. Theophylline, caffeine, and D,L-4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (Ro20-1724) inhibited the enzyme activity in both tumors; the percent inhibition was the same by each inhibitor.

      "Evoked neurotransmitter release: statistical effects of nonuniformity and nonstationarity. Recent studies of the mechanism of quantal neurotransmitter release have assumed that the number of quanta released at each stimulation is binomially distributed and have sought to estimate the binomial parameters n and p. Mathematical analysis and computer simulations show that temporal variation in the number of eligible or filled release sites and either spatial or temporal variation in the probability of release at a site can drastically bias such estimates, while the experimental histograms remain statistically indistinguishable from those predicted by the binomial law. Interpretation of the estimates n and p in terms of ultrastructural or physiological characteristics of the nerve terminal is liable to significant error if departures from the binomial assumptions are not suitably assessed.",

In physiological concentrations, retinol uptake in vitro by everted gut sacs was unaffected by anoxia or metabolic inhibitors and uncouplers. In vivo retinol absorption rate was decreased when sodium taurocholate concentration was raised above 5 mM, or when 2.5 mM linoleic or linolenic acids were added to the perfusate. Absorption increased markedly as the thickness of the unstirred water layer was diminished. Variations in perfusate pH from 4.5 to 8.6 did not change the retinol absorption rate.

Comparison of the stimulatory effects of retinol derivatives on the esterase activity revealed that retinyl acetate was the most active, being sustantially similar in effect to retinol; retinal was fairly active, while retinoic acid, retinyl palmitate, and beta-ionone were far less active. 3. With various isoprenoid compounds, the efficiency of stimulation increased with the carbon chain length, attaining a maximum at 15 to 20 carbon atoms. Above this chain length the efficiency decreased rapidly. 4.

      "Kinetics of carboxymethylation of histidine hydantoin. The reaction of the imidazole group of histidine hydantoin with bromoacetate was studied as a model for carboxymethylation of histidine residues in proteins. pK values of 6.4 and 9.1 (25 degrees C) and apparent heats of ionization of 7.8 and 8.7 kcal/mol were determined for the imidazole and hydantoin rings, respectively. At pH values corresponding to the isoelectric points for histidine hydantoin, the rates of carboxymethylation at 12, 25, 37, and 50 degrees C were determined; the modified hydantoins were hydrolyzed to the corresponding histidine derivatives for quantitative amino acid analysis. At pH 7.72 and 25 degrees C, the imidazole tele-N was alkylated (k = 3.9 X 10(-5) M-1 s-1) twice as fast as the pros-N. The monocarboxymethyl derivatives were carboxymethylated at the same rate at the pros-N (k = 2.1 X 10(-5) M-1 s-1) but 3 times faster at the tele-N (k = 11 X 10(-5) M-1 s-1). The enthalpies of activation determined for carboxymethylation of the imidazole ring and its monocarboxymethyl derivatives were similar (15.9 +/- 0.7 kcal/mol). delta S for the four carboxymethylations was -25 +/- 2 eu. The electrostatic component of delta S (delta S es) was calculated from the influence of the dielectric constant on the reaction rate at 25 degrees C. delta S es was slightly negative (-4 +/- 1 eu) for mono- or dicarboxymethylations, indicating some charge separation in the transition state. The nonelectrostatic entropy of activation was -21 +/- 2 eu for all four carboxymethylations.",

This metabolite was synthesized in the laboratory from 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone. Gas chromatographic and mass spectrometric comparison of the permethylated synthetic compound with the permethylated derivative of the metabolite obtained from biological sources showed that they were identical. The metabolite was excreted as a glucuronide and accounted for about 1% of the total hydroxylated metabolites of DPH in human urine and rat bile. When the synthetic standard was added to the recirculating perfusate of the isolated perfused rat liver, a monoglucuronide, a trihydroxy-DPH glucuronide, and a dihydroxymethoxy-DPH glucuronide were identified in the bile."

      "A computational theory of human stereo vision. An algorithm is proposed for solving the stereoscopic matching problem. The algorithm consists of five steps: (1) Each image is filtered at different orientations with bar masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the equivalent filters are one or two octaves wide. (2) Zero-crossings in the filtered images, which roughly correspond to edges, are localized. Positions of the ends of lines and edges are also found. (3) For each mask orientation and size, matching takes place between pairs of zero-crossings or terminationss of the same sign in the two images, for a range of disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. (4) Wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into correspondence. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1/2-D sketch. It is shown that this proposal provides a theoretical framework for most existing psychophysical and neurophysiological data about stereopsis. Several critical experimental predictions are also made, for instance about the size of Panum's area under various conditions. The results of such experiments would tell us whether, for example, cooperativity is necessary for the matching process.",

      "Effects of dietary vitamin B-2 and vitamin E on the delta9-desaturase and catalase activities in the rat liver microsomes. The effects of dietary vitamin B-2 and vitamin E on delta9-desaturation  of stearoyl-CoA, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and electron transport components in rat liver microsomes have been investigated. delta9-desaturase activities were decreased on diets deficient of vitamin B-2, E and supplemented with E. Among the peroxide-scavenging enzymes, only the catalase activity in microsomes correlates significantly with delta9-desaturase activity. In vitro addition of bovine catalase had no effect on microsomal delta9-desaturase activity on control diet. However, it enhanced the delta9-desaturation in microsomes on vitamin B-2-deficient diet which contained low catalase and high superoxide dismutase activities, compared to those in microsomes of control diet. It is suggested that the hydrogen peroxide-generating and -decomposing systems may play an important role on the delta9-desaturase activity in microsomes.",
      "Filterability of erythrocytes from vitamin E-deficient lead-poisoned rats. The time required for red blood cells (RBC) from vitamin E-deficient lead-poisoned (-E + Pb) rats to pass through polycarbonate filters after incubation in vitro was much greater than that of RBC from vitamin E-supplemented non-poisoned rats. Vitamin E deficiency per se (i.e., in non-poisoned rats) often increased filtration times, but in all such experiments the RBC from -E + Pb groups had even longer filtration times. Administration of lead to rats supplemented with vitamin E had little effect on the filtration rate of RBC. N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPPD) prevented the increased filtration times characteristic of RBC from -E + Pb rats, but replacement of the lard in the vitamin E-deficient basal diet by more highly polyunsaturated fats did not exacerbate the increased filtration times of RBC from -E + Pb rats. The increased filtration time of RBC from -E + Pb rats appeared to be related to the extent of RBC lipid peroxidation. Decreasing the pH of the RBC incubation medium from 7.4 to 6.6, an acidity typical of the spleen, markedly increased the filtration times of RBC from -E + Pb rats. Addition of lead in vitro increased filtration times of RBC from both vitamin E-deficient and supplemented non-poisoned rats, but filtration times tended to be longer in the deficient group. These results suggest that vitamin E deficiency and lead toxicity act synergistically to alter the deformability of the RBC thereby rendering it vulnerable to sequestration in the spleen."

      "Passive serum sickness in the mouse: the role of vasoactive amines in glomerular deposition of immune complexes. This paper reports a study of the importance of vasoactive amines in glomerular localization of passively administered immune complexes in the mouse. Two strains of mice were investigated, one sensitive and the other relatively resistant to the anaphylactogenic effect of intravenously administered immune complexes. The effect on glomerular deposition immune complexes in animals of both strains treated with either vasoactive amine depletors or antagonists leads to the conclusion that in this experimental system vasoactive amines do not play a major part in the glomerular localization of immune complexes.",
      "[Study of the amniotic fluid of sheep in the normal course of pregnancy and in abortion]. Cytologic, biochemical and immunoelectrophoretic studies were carried out of amniotic fluids in 100 ewes with normal pregnancy and 40 ewes that had miscarried. Each month of pregnancy a total of 20 and 8 animals of the two groups, respectively were studied. It was found that the biochemical and metabolic processes taking place in the fetus lead to changes in the amniotic fluids altering the pH value, the alkali reserve, the content of potassium, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase as well as their bactericidal activity. More characteristic changes linked with pregnancy were observed in the cell composition of the amniotic fluids. With advancing in age the increase in cell count was accompanied (staining with Nile blue sulfate) with a rise of the \"orange cell\" content. The amniotic fluids of ewes with normal pregnancy were found to contain proteins which precipitated with hyper immune sera against blood serum and kidney, heart, and placenta proteins. In ewes that had miscarried the pH values of the amniotic fluids dropped in the months when abortions took place: 7.36, 7.11, 6.90, 6.80 and 6.90, as against 7.41, 7.36, 7.28, 7.17 and 7.18, respectively. Along with pH the alkali reserve also dropped to 37.9 in the first month and 14.20 in the fifth month. In ewes that had miscarried in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th month these values were 18.90, 14.90, and 13.80 cu. cm, respectively. In cases of abortions the protein composition of the amniotic fluids showed higher levels of the alfa and beta globulins."

The combination of CEA, hepatic function marker enzymes, and four acute phase reactant proteins (haptoglobin, alpha 1 antitrypsin, alpha 1 acid glycoprotein, and prealbumin) has been used to monitor patients with colorectal cancer receiving chemotherapy. In 18 patients with advanced lesions who survived at least 3 months treatment the markers predicted progression in 92% of 25 incidents of progression; the mean lead time was 2.8 months. A rising CEA was only present in 28%, but in these patients it gave a mean lead time of 4 months. In the group of 14 patients with minimal residual disease progression to clinically detectable disease has occurred in 9 of them. In these cases the markers predicted progression with a mean lead time of 6 months; in a further six patients the markers have indicated progression, but as yet their disease is not detectable, the mean lead time being at least 8.6 months.

      "Serum enzymes in colorectal cancer. A study of the value of serum enzymes in 184 patients with colorectal cancer has been performed. The enzymes studied were gamma glutamyltransferase (gammaGT), alkaline phosphatase (AP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT), glutathione reductase (GR), alanine and aspartate transaminases. In patients without liver metastases, elevated enzyme levels were found in 11-55% preoperatively. 5'-NT showed the least number of elevated activities, while gammaGT activities were increased in 29% and LDH in 55%. The percentage of elevated enzyme levels rose significantly in the early postoperative period. Patients with liver metastases showed increased enzyme activities in 40-60% preoperatively: gammaGT was the most sensitive indicator. Increased enzyme activity was related to the degree of liver involvement with secondary tumor. With extensive liver metastases, gammaGT levels were increased in 82%. It is concluded that serum enzymes are of limited value in the preoperative detection of liver metastases, and particularly when tumor involvement of the liver is small.",
      "Role of the vacuolar apparatus in augmented protein degradation in cultured fibroblasts. Rat embryo fibroblasts, grown in Eagle's MEM with 10% serum, showed a rapid increase in autophagic vacuoles when placed in MEM with 0-1% serum. Concurrent with this response, degradation of cellular proteins showed a 2-fold increase. We did not find any increases in cathepsin D, beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase, and beta-glucosidase, or proteolytic activity of cell homogenates at pH 3.7 towards endogenous substrates. Homogenates prepared in 250 mM sucrose at pH 7.0 showed a 40% increase in protein breakdown. These data support the hypothesis that the induced increase in proteolysis, characteristic of cells placed in a nutritionally deficient medium, is effected by an activated vacuolar apparatus (lysosomes and autophagic vacuoles). We suggest, however, that this mechanism is distinct from normal protein turnover in the cell, but can be rapidly induced by appropriate alterations in the cellular environment. Finally, this induced proteolytic mechanism is not dependent upon an increase in lysosomal enzymes, but rather a structural alteration within the cell which effects a transfer of cellular proteins into the vacuolar apparatus."

      "Successful bone marrow transplantation against mixed lymphocyte culture barrier. If bone marrow transplantation is to become widely applicable in the treatment of patients with leukemia and aplastic anemia, the necessity to have a perfectly histocompatible donor must be overcome. In an effort to define the roles of HL-A type and mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) reactivity in the determination of successful engraftment and the occurrence of graftversus-host disease (GVHD), we have attempted transplantation of a child with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) using an HL-A identical, MLC-reactive sibling donor. Successful engraftment has been accomplished, as documented by the appearance of multiple donor genetic markers in the recipient. There is no evidence of severe GVHD. The recipient is alive, without evidence of leukemia, and has returned to full activities 9 mo after transplantation. The recipient now produces lymphocytes, which have the MLC reactivity that characterize the donor's lymphocytes, rather than that of her own pretransplant lymphocytes. This experience demonstrates that successful bone marrow transplantation in patients with leukemia can be accomplished in the face of MLC reactivity.",
      "Graft versus leukemia. VI. Adoptive immunotherapy in combination with chemoradiotherapy for spontaneous leukemia-lymphoma in AKR mice. A three-step treatment plan incorporating adoptive immunotherapy and chemoradiotherapy was used to treat AKR (H-2k) mice bearing spontaneous leukemia-lymphoma (SLL). 1) Leukemic mice were treated with chemoradiotherapy for immunosuppression and leukemia cytoreduction. 2) To introduce a graft-versus-leukemia reaction against residual malignant cells, the immunosuppressed AKR mice were given immunocompetent cells from H-2 mismatched DBA/2 (H-2d) donors. 3) To \"rescue\" the AKR hosts from incipient graft-versus-host disease, the mismatched DBA/2 cells were killed with combination chemotherapy, and cells from allogeneic H-2 matched RF (H-2k) donors were administered to restore hematopoiesis. Leukemic AKR mice thus treated had significant prolongation of their median survival time and a higher 60-day survival rate post treatment than did untreated controls, chemoradiotherapy controls, or control mice that received chemoradiotherapy plus cells from syngeneic donors. Therefore, adoptive immunotherapy may be useful as an adjunct to conventional therapy for treatment of SLL in AKR mice."

The DNAs from both competent and noncompetent cells were found to contain similar extents of single-stranded regions. These single-stranded regions appeared to be intact, unpaired regions in double-stranded DNA rather than gaps, nicks, or unpaired ends in the DNA. Inhibition of cells with rifampin prior to lysis increased the amount of such single strandedness in the DNA. Lysates made at various times after [14C]thymidine-labeled cells had bound [3H]thymidine-labeled transforming DNA were also characterized by benzoylated, naphthoylated diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. Changes in the elution profiles of DNA from cells exposed to homospecific (S. pneumoniae) donor DNA were indicative of the formation of complexes between donor DNA and the single-stranded regions of recipient DNA.

      "Induction of prophage SPO2 in Bacillus subtilis: isolation of excised prophage DNA as a covently closed circle. Bacillus subtilis tryC2, thyA, thyB, lysogenic for the phage DNA polymerase negative mutant SPO2 susL244, was induced under conditions preventing phage and bacterial DNA synthesis. The biological activity of DNA from induced cells and from uninduced controls was assayed by transformation and transfection, respectively. About 50% of the phage DNA biological activity in DNA extracted from induced cells was resistant to exposure to pH 11.8 TO 11.9. This DNA was operationally defined as alkali-resistant phage DNA. Transforming bacterial DNA from uninduced or induced cells and transfecting DNA from uninduced cells were more than 95% inactivated after exposure to high pH. The alkali-resistant phage DNA was characterized by sucrose gradient centrifugation, by centrifugation in cesium chloride-propidium iodide, and by electron microscopy. It was found to consist of a majority of covalently closed circular DNA molecules. Length measurements of a few relaxed circular molecules indicate a molecular weight of these similar to that previously found for mature SPO2DNA. Attempts to isolate similar covalently closed circular phage DNA from induced bacteria lysogenic for SPO2 phage with a functional DNA polymerase gene were unsuccessful. The gene order in mature and prophage SPO2 was determined by rescue of single and double markers from the respective type of DNA. The data obtained show that prophage DNA is (genetically) permuted relative to mature DNA. The phage attachment site is suggested to be located between genes I and J.",
      "Phosphofructokinase. III. Correlation of the regulatory kinetic and molecular properties of the rabbit muscle enzyme. It is shown that the degree of regulatory kinetic behavior of rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase increases at a given pH and lower temperatures, as well as at a given temperature and lower pH values. It is also shown that the regulatory kinetic behavior which appears at lower pH values is inherent in the tetrameric (active) form of the enzyme. We conclude that a portion of the mechanism proposed previously (Bock, P.E., and Frieden, C. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5630-5636) to describe the pH and temperature-dependent inactivation or reactivation may also be used to explain the pH and temperature-dependent regulatory kinetic behavior. According to this proposal, two rapidly equilibrating forms of the enzyme, which differ in the degree of protonation of specific residues, differ in their ability to bind substrates. While the protonated form of the enzyme subsequently becomes inactive by isomerization and dissociation, this process is too slow to affect the kinetic results, making direct comparisons between the association-dissociation behavior and regulatory kinetic behavior invalid. The time dependence of the processes of inactivation or reactivation in the presence or absence of ligands and of the appearance of regulatory kinetic behavior is discussed in relation to their possible role in metabolic regulation."

Injection of a single dose of conduritol B epoxide into mice produced almost complete destruction of glucocerebrosidase (D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.45) in liver, spleen, brain, and kidney within 5 h. Restoration of activity became noticeable within 1 day (2 days in the case of brain) and was about 80% of normal within 16 days. 2. The same injection produced less destruction of aryl beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21), measured at pH 5.4 with methylumbelliferyl glucoside in the absence of taurocholate. Brain showed the least amount of destruction, about 50%, but measurements of activity at lower pH values revealed complete loss of activity. This suggests that brain contains two different aryl glucosidases with differing sensitivity to the inhibitor. Liver, on the other hand, did not show differential destruction when assayed at different pH values. Resynthesis of the enzyme activities was almost complete by 16 days. 3. Injection of phenylhydrazine produced hemolysis and spleen enlargement, with concomitant increases in specific activities of glucocerebrosidase and aryl glucosidase in liver and spleen (but not in kidney). When this experiment was done in mice previously treated with conduritol B expoxide, the reappearance of cerebrosidase was found to be accelerated. This is interpreted to mean that the increased load of glucolipids from the erythrocytes had induced an enhanced synthesis of the glucohydrolase. A similar explanation may apply to aryl glucosidase and glucopeptides in the cells.",
      "Suppression of in vitro cytotoxic response by macrophages due to induced arginase. Arginine was found to be completely depleted from cell-free supernates of mixed leukocyte cultures suppressed by the addition of excess macrophages. Partial reversal of macrophage-mediated suppression was accomplished by daily addition of a cocktail containing arginine and nonamino acid nutrients. Complete reversal of the suppression was accomplished by the addition of arginine and glucose to the medium and the nonadherent cells after their separation from the adherent macrophages. A marked increase in the enzyme arginase was found in macrophages that had been cultured 24 h in vitro in Eagle's minimum essential medium plus 10% fetal calf serum, in peritoneal cells activated by prior injection of thioglycollate, and in one spleen activated by a graft vs. host reaction.",
      "The capacity of microsomally-activated cyclophosphamide to induce immunosuppression in vitro. Cyclophosphamide (CY) was activated in vitro with washed rat liver microsomes and cofactors. Pretreatment of mouse spleen cells in vitro with the activated drug abolished their capacity to give a primary antibody response to SRBC and levan on transfer to irradiated syngeneic recipients. However, responsiveness returned if challenge was delayed for 7 or more days after transfer. Part of this was shown to be of donor origin by an allotype marker. The treatment of normal spleen cells with activated CY in vitro also prevented B cells from regenerating their immunoglobulin receptors after capping with anti-immunoglobulin serum. The induction of suppression required contact between lymphocytes and activated CY for at least 30 min at 37 degrees and did not appear following incubation for 1 h at 0 degrees. Since the antibody response of drug-treated spleen cells to SRBC could not be restored with purified normal B or T cells, it is probable that B and T lymphocytes are both susceptible to suppression by activated CY in vitro. Similar pretreatment abrogated the graft-versus-host (GVH) reactivity of spleen cells as measured by survival and in a popliteal lymph node assay. B cell chimerism in F1 recipients of drug-treated parental spleen cells was demonstrated by the presence of congenic allotype markers. This suggests a possible approach for the attenuation of GVH disease which is associated with bone marrow transplantation in man."

      "Adherence of serotype e Streptococcus mutans and the inhibitory effect of Lancefield group E and S mutans type e antiserum. S mutans strain MT703 from an active carious lesion in the tooth of a child had type e specificity and showed a cross-reaction with the Lancefield group E cell wall streptococcal polysaccharide antigen. Heat-killed cells MT703 adhered to a glass surface in the presence of CGT MT703 and sucrose. Pretreatment of the cells with anti-MT703 whole cell serums inhibited adherecne. The removal of glycerol teichoic acid antibody and group E antibody from the MT703 serum did not result in a loss of inhibitory activity. Antiserum with or without adsorption significantly inhibited glucan synthesis by CGT from sucrose. Antibodies specific for the polyglycerol phosphate of teichoic acid did not inhibit adherence. Anti-group E serum and serums specific for other types of S mutans, did not show adherence inhibitory activity except for an occasional type c specific antiserum. Antibody specific for the type e antigen produced significant inhibition of the binding of CGT to the MT703 cell wall, and adherence of these cells did not occur. Antibody to CGT inhibited glucan synthesis. Treatment of the cells with dextranase, dextran antibody, or trypsin caused a significant reduction in adherence. The results suggest that the type antigen and dextran on the surface of the S mutans type e cell are functional in adherence, and that these polymers are associated with cell wall protein.",

A similar enzyme was found in the flight muscle of all other insects investigated, but at much lower activities. 2. ACa2+-stimulated oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity was present in all insect flight-muscle preparations investigated, in constant proportion to the NAD-linked \"malic\" enzyme. 3. A partial purification of the NAD-linked \"malic\" enzyme from Glossina was effected by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, which separated the enzyme from malate dehydrogenase and NADP-linked \"malic\" enzyme, but not from oxaloacetate decarboxylase. 4. The intracellular localization of the NAD-linked \"malic\" enzyme was predominantly mitochondrial; latency studies suggested a localization in the mitochondrial matrix space. 5.

      "Nuclear magnetic resonance studies of sperm whale myoglobin specifically enriched with 13C in the methionine methyl groups. The Cepsilon methyl group of the 2 methionine residues in sperm whale myoglobin was enriched with respect to 13C. This was accomplished by treatment of the apomyoglobin at pH 4 at room temperature with a 100-fold proportion of 13CH3I to form an intermediate containing enriched S-methylmethionine. Unselective demethylation to regain the apomyoglobin structure was accomplished by treatment at pH 10.5 with 0.5 M dithioerythritol at 37 degrees for 18 h. Reagents were removed at each stage by dialysis against dilute sodium azide solution. Hemin was reincorporated to form the holoprotein in a way that avoided the presence of an excess of the small molecule. After chromatographic purification the enriched myoglobin was obtained in a yield of between 29 and 60%. The composition, absorbance spectrum, circular dichroism spectrum, isoionic point, electrophoretic behavior, and oxygen-binding behavior following reduction were all indistinguishable from those of the virgin protein. NMR measurements were made at 15.1, 25.2, and 67.9 MHz at 27-30 degrees. The two enriched loci are represented by separate resonances that appear slightly downfield of the spectral position of the corresponding resonance in free methionine. The positions of these resonances are sensitive to pH and to the ligand bound at the heme group which is approximately 17 A distant from each methionine Cepsilon. On the basis of two separate types of experiment the downfield resonance was assigned to methionine 55 and the upfield resonance to methionine 131. Part of the observed variations in chemical shift could be treated as arising from pseudocontact interactions but part was ascribed to structural changes communicated to the environment of each methionine residue as a result of changes in heme ligand, pH, or temperature. The linewidths of the methionine Cepsilon resonances are narrowed by increasing temperature according to an Arrhenius energy of activation of nearly 3 kcal. The spin-lattice relaxation times, T1, of the two methionine Cepsilon resonances at the three spectrometer frequencies were interpreted to indicate the existence of rotational motions in each side chain in addition to that about the Sdelta-Cepsilon bond. The results as a whole show that the two methionine side chains undergo continuous variations in environment, and that these variations are controlled by events at a distance within the protein structure. It is suggested that the structural lability serves the function of facilitating conformational variations and adjustments within the heme pocket.",
      "Overmethylation of DNAs by the EcoRI methylase. EcoRI methylase is able to catalyze methy incorporation into DNA at sequences other than the canonical EcoRI site. At high enzyme concentrations and over a wide range of pH and ionic strengths, EcoRI methylase modifies polyoma DNA (which contains one EcoRI site) at a number of sites. This modification prevents EcoRI endonuclease activity, and thus is presumably at or near the EcoRI sequences (5') NAATTN."

In a study of groups of patients with atopic (extrinsic) asthma, non-atopic (intrinsic) asthma, and chronic bronchitis, no difference could be detected in the numbers having precipitating antibodies against species specific antigens from Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae compared to suitably matched control subjects. Precipitating antibodies against species specific antigens from Haemophilus influenzae, demonstrated in this investigation by double diffusion in agar gel, were found much more frequently in patients with chronic mucopurulent or obstructive bronchitis (50%) than in either asthmatic subjects (6%) or normal controls (6%) (P = less than 0.0005). While the precipitating antibody demonstrated in these patients against the extracts of Str. pneumoniae and Staph. aureus was in the IgG class alone, IgM and IgA antibody were detected against the species specific but not the non-species specific antigens of H. influenzae. These results underline the importance of H. influenzae as an infecting agent in chronic bronchitis and suggest that the finding of precipitins against the species specific H1 and H2 antigens of this bacterium denotes infection either concurrently or in the recent past. There is no evidence to suggest from this study that infection with Staph. aureus, Str. pneumoniae or H. influenzae is any more common in asthmatics as a group compared to controls or between patients with the non-atopic (intrinsic) and atopic (extrinsic) form of the disease.",

Mean insulin concentration in solitary adenomas and in adenomas of patients with adenomatosis was higher than in control pancreases; however, in all but 1 patient the insulin concentration in neoplastic islet tissue was lower than in islet tissue of control pancreas, assuming islet volume is 1% of pancreas. The percentage of proinsulin was elevated in 52% of tumors. Adenoma insulin content correlated with increments of plasma insulin after tolbutamide administration. Insulin and proinsulin concentrations in pancreas uninvolved by tumor were not suppressed. Fasting plasma glucagon was elevated in patients with islet cell adenomatosis and in patients with islet cell carcinoma some of whom had multiple endocrine adenomatosis. The mean concentration of glucagon in tumors was lower than in control pancreases. Elevated concentration of gastrin was found in some adenomas. The data indicate: 1) insulin-secreting islet cell tumors have decreased storage capacity for insulin, 2) elevated concentration of proinsulin in tumors may be due to decreased capacity to store insulin and in some to decreased conversion of proinsulin to insulin as well, 3) tolbutamide stimulates the exaggerated release of a relatively constant fraction of insulin stored in adenomas. 4) solitary adenomas may contain excess amounts of pancreatic hormones in addition to insulin, 5) elevated plasma glucagon in patients with organic hyperinsulinism may indicate malignancy, microadenomatosis or multiple endocrine adenoma syndrome, and 6) chronic hyperinsulinism and hypoglycemia due to adenoma do not suppress insulin and proinsulin content of uninvolved pancreas.",

In schizophrenic patients there is an increase of the methylating activity which significantly correlated with hallucinatory symptoms in the clinical picture. In patients with cataono-paranoid, paranoid syndromes and simple forms of schizophrenia the methylating activity is seen significantly less frequently. The disappearance of alleviation of hallucinations, due to neuroleptical drugs is accompanied by normalization of the methylating activity.

These issues are of fundamental importance in the development of psychiatry both as art and craft. Thus the paper deals both with the study of madness and madness itself. The title of the address illustrates some forms of communication which occur in the schizophrenias. It includes references to other ideas, to formal thought disorder and illogical thinking, private puns, vague links, and pointers to other sources and authors, namely, Bleuler (1950), Ernest Jones (1959) and Thouless (1974).

The production of sorbose by Acetobacter suboxydans (4) is closely related to the concentration of sorbit in the medium. An increasing concentration of sorbit gives rise to the inhibition of cell reproduction; followed by a decrease of sorbose content in the culture medium. The decrease of sorbose yield in concentrations of about 15% sorbit in medium indicates the decreasing metabolism rate of the total population of Acetobacter suboxydans (4) culture and does not refer to the ability of the individual bacterium cell to produce sorbose. Relevant research work showed, that sorbose production for each bacterium cell distinctly increased with the decrease of the number of cells in a population of Acetobacter suboxydans (4) as a consequence of the application of an increased sorbit concentration. An unrestrained reproduction of bacteria could be obtained by exluding all factors involved in the contamination of sorbit and exhibiting toxic effects. Therefore the organisms could be offered a greater concentration of sorbit for conversion into sorbose. Thus sorbose yield would be increased, respectively. The total conversion of the C-source into sorbose could not be obtained with Acetobacter ruboxydans (4).",

Pulmonary arterial hypertension was only found in the presence of frank hypoxemia and disappeared with the correction of the latter. If there was no hemodynamic profile due to P.E. itself, its etiology sometimes induced a hyperkinetic or hypovolemic syndrome. Finally it was apparent that PCP was significantly higher- although normal- at the initial stage than after 6 hours of P.E.; that an elevation in PCP of only a few mm Hg by the perfusion of colloids aggravated the P.E., that despite the normal value for the PCP dehydration evidently improved hematosis. Thus this study confirms that numerous cases of P.E. can occur while the PCP remains normal.

      "Fetal hypertension and the development of increased pulmonary vascular smooth muscle: a possible mechanism for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn infant. Chronic pulmonary arterial hypertension was produced in six fetal lambs. In four (126 to 139 days' gestation) unilateral fetal renal artery constriction caused systemic arterial mean blood pressure elevations. In another fetus, constriction of the umbilical artery caused a systemic mean blood pressure elevation; in the sixth, partial occlusion of the ductus arteriosus caused isolated pulmonary arterial hypertension. The right lung of each fetus was perfused with fixative at the in vivo mean arterial pressure and the amount of smooth muscle in the fifth generation (resistance) vessels analyzed using the medial width/external diameter ratio. There was a significant increase in the medial width/external diameter ratio in the six experimental animals as compared to that in six normal fetuses. In separate fetuses the increased ratios were due to a decreased external diameter, increased smooth muscle, or both these factors. The total number of resistance vessels was counted in the right lung of each fetus and no significant difference from normal was observed. We postulate that either fetal systemic hypertension or constriction of the ductus arteriosus causes fetal pulmonary hypertension in utero and that this produces increased smooth muscle development in pulmonary arterial resistance vessels; this may be a pathogenic mechanism for the syndrome of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn infant."

It now seems that, at least for inhibitory central pathways in which cyclic AMP-generating systems mediate postsynaptic receptor-responses, alterations in synaptic input lead in rat cortex to predictable super- or subsensitivity of the norepinephrine-sensitive cyclic AMP-systems. Supersensitivity of histamine-sensitive cyclic AMP-systems also occurs in rat cortex as a result of apparent lesions of histaminergic tracts. The reason that supersensitivity does not develop to norepinephrine and histamine in guinea pig cortex after similar \"denervations\" is not known, but is central to an understanding of the factors involved in the role of cyclic AMP-mechanisms to the adaptive plasticity of the central nervous system. However, even before an understanding of all the factors involved in alterations in cyclic AMP-responses in brain tissue is obtained, studies on the effects of environmental and drug-manipulations can provide insights both into the central roles for cyclic AMP-mechanisms and into the nature of drug action. Clearly, an understanding of the interelationships of synaptic input and adaptive changes in postsynaptic cyclic AMP-systems and the exploitation of such knowledge for the elucidation of central adaptive function is an exciting challenge for future research.",
      "Overmethylation of DNAs by the EcoRI methylase. EcoRI methylase is able to catalyze methy incorporation into DNA at sequences other than the canonical EcoRI site. At high enzyme concentrations and over a wide range of pH and ionic strengths, EcoRI methylase modifies polyoma DNA (which contains one EcoRI site) at a number of sites. This modification prevents EcoRI endonuclease activity, and thus is presumably at or near the EcoRI sequences (5') NAATTN.",
      "Ecology of Keystone virus, a transovarially maintained arbovirus. Our studies in the Pocomoke Cypress Swamp of Maryland have shown that KEY strain of CE is endemic and is carried by the floodwater mosquito A. atlanticus. The virus is transmitted transstadially in nature, as evidenced by our recovery of virus from larvae and males of this species. Serologic evidence, both here and elsewhere, indicates that vertebrates are infected with KEY, but their role in the transmission cycle remains unknown. We have found several animals, for example, the gray squirrel, that are potential vertebrate reservoirs for the virus. Gray squirrels possess antibodies to KEY in nature, are known to be fed upon by A. atlanticus females, and have been shown to circulate a high-titered viremia after experimental inoculation. Evidence from 1974 collections, however, indicates that A. atlanticus females ingested only a single blood meal during the period when adults were active. We will not be able to assess the relative importance of the vertebrate and mosquito cycles until much more work has been performed on vector-reservoir-virus dynamics."

II. Role of compartmentation and of organized multienzyme systems]. The picture, emerging from the experimental results on the physical association of multienzyme systems, is that the true physiological significance of the aggregated state can be understood only if it is correlated to the structural and functional integration of the cellular metabolic framework as a whole. The enzyme clusters exhibit two distinct functional properties. The first is the spatial translocation of intermediate substrates, the effect of which may be viewed as metabolic \"channelling\" or \"vectorial catalysis\" if the enzyme clusters are arrayed in some manner in the cell. The second is the coordinate regulation which represents an efficient and economical mean of controlling two or more functionally related enzymes. The common element to these two properties is the spatial character, which is potentially present in the function and the regulation of the intermediary metabolism. The biological systems, and metabolism in particular, exhibit both stability and variability; the latter sometimes assumes the character of periodicity. Whether the oscillations have a definite importance at the level of the intermediary metabolism itself, may well be questioned; the oscillatory faculties may rather serve as elements to be used in more complex functions of the biological systems. A thorough understanding of the role of clustered multienzyme systems and of the oscillatory phenomena in cellular metabolism demands a clearer physicochemical picture of the dynamic state of the living cell than we have at present. For this reason some of the generalizations derived from in vitro studies of single, isolated enzyme activities are not justified.",

Regulation of the expression of the histidase coded by hutk of Klebsiella aerogenes in Salmonella typhimurium and in Escherichia coli and of the expression of the histidase coded by huts of S. typhimurium in E. coli was investigated. The hutk histidase was found to be sensitive to catabolite repression in K. aerogenes and in E. coli, but insensitive to catabolite repression in S. typhimurium; huts histidase has previously been shown to be catabolite sensitive in all three organisms. The expression of both hutk and huts histidase in E. coli was activated by nitrogen starvation. Apparently, the glutamine synthetase of E. coli may activate the formation of some glutamate- and ammonia-producing enzymes.",
      "Cyclic nucleotides in the regulation of expression of differentiated functions in neuroblastoma cells. Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) may be one of the important factors in regulating the expression of many differentiated functions in neuroblastoma cells, but some of these functions can be induced by agents that do not increase the intracellular level of cAMP. An elevation of the intracellular level of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) neither induced differentiation nor antagonized the effects of cAMP. Neuroblastoma cells increased the level of cAMP-binding proteins during differentiation, whereas glial cells and L-cells did not. This might have accounted in part for an increase in the intracellular level of cAMP even in the presence of high phosphodiesterase activity in neuroblastoma cells, since the protein-bound with the same proteins, but cAMP had about 10 times higher affinity than did cGMP. cAMP promoted the organization of microtubules and microfilaments necessary for the expression of differentiated phenotypes. The extension of neurites required the synthesis of new protein, but it did not need the synthesis of new RNA. cAMP induced differentiation in neuroblastoma cells by increasing the expression of some genetic information while suppressing the expression of others; e.g., the activities of neural enzymes increased, whereas the synthesis of histone and the phosphorylation of H1-histone markedly decreased in differentiated cells. A hypothesis was offered: An increase in cAMP phosphodiesterase activity as a result of mutation in the regulatory gene for phosphodiesterase in a single, or group of, dividing nerve cell(s) is the primary lesion that leads to malignancy. Based on the concept that selective cytocytoxic drugs should be used with agents that cause differentiation, a new therapeutic approach was suggested for the treatment of neuroblastoma. This involved administration of sodium butyrate followed by L-DOPA or prostaglandin E1 in the presence of cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor followed by the less immunosuppressive vincristine and 5-(3,3-dimethyl-1-triazeno)imidazole-4-carboxamide."

Metabolic rates and intercellular transfer of metabolites were studied in human glia and glioma culture cells via topographic scan of NAD(P)H fluorescence by multichannel microfluorometry in conjunction with microinjection of glucose-6-P + allosteric activators. Metabolic rates evaluated from NAD(P) in equilibrium NAD(P)H transients and the required substrate levels were 3--4 times lower in glioma  cells as compared to glia cells. Both glia and glioma cells showed variability in the occurrence of intercellular metabolite transfer, detectable via observation of a transient in a neighbour of the cell injected with substrate. On this basis \"multicellular integrated states\" can be defined in clusters of glioma and glia cells interconnected by cell-to-cell contact and a mesh-like network of intercellular processes. Such multicellular steady states and the associated metabolic rates or their impairment can be used in turn to classify different culture lines in reference to cell physiology and pathology.",
      "Regulation of nerve growth factor content in C6 glioma cells by beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation. The C6 glioma cell line contains nerve growth factor (NGF) which can be released into the medium. Treatment of the cells with beta-adrenoceptor agonists resulted in increased content of NGF in both the cells and the medium within a few hours, whereas alpha-adrenoceptor agonists were ineffective. The response was blocked by beta- but not alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists. The increase of the NGF content of glioma cells appeared to be mediated by an elevation of cyclic AMP or GMP. The addition to the cell cultures of other putative neurotransmitters failed to change the content of either NGF or cyclic AMP. These results are discussed with respect to a model for adrenergic neuron-glial interactions.",
      "Transient inhibition of cell proliferation in rat glioma monolayer cultures by cortisol. The effect of 3 muM cortisol on cell proliferation in rat glioma (strain C6) monolayer cultures was investigated. Cell density measurements showed that cortisol-treated C6 cells continued to proliferate at maximum log phase rates for 1 to 2 days. Then cell proliferation ceased as growth in control cultures continued into stationary phase. A 2-day period of growth inhibition followed during which cell densities were 30 to 50% lower relative to controls. Growth resumed subsequently, and final cell densities were similar to those of controls. The presence of epicortisol (the biologically inactive isomer of cortisol) in the culture medium did not alter the rate of log phase growth relative to controls. During the initial period of continued growth after exposure to cortisol, the pH of the medium decreased at the same rate in control and treated cultures. During the growth-inhibitory period, erythrosin B dye was excluded equally well (greater than 94%) by control and treated cells, and no morphological differences were detected by phase contrast microscopy. When the culture medium was replaced daily, the control cells at elevated densities continued to proliferate at a reduced rate. In cortisol-treated cultures, the period of growth inhibition commenced 3 days after the cells were exposed initially to cortisol. A 2-day period of growth inhibition followed during which the pH of the 1-day-old media from both control and treated cultures decreased from 7.4 to 6.9. Growth resumed subsequently in the treated cultures to produce elevated cell densities similar to those of controls. These results demonstrate that cortisol at concentrations considered chemotherapeutic in vivo exerts a transient inhibitory effect on C6 glioma cell proliferation."

The psycho-pathological rating resulted in an acute organic brain syndrome with predominance of confusion, sometimes progressing to delirium. EEG was changed during the psychotic stage. These changes cannot be decided from organic psychoses, which are not related to drugs. Patients with Parkinson's disease showed a relatively high incidence to psychoses during drug treatment (51.47%). In patients without Parkinson's disease, but on treatment with antidepressants, neuroleptics, diuretics and digitalis, pharmacotoxic psychoses only could be observed in 4.4% of the patients. However, the same group of patients showed an acute organic brain syndrome in 12.43%, when not on treatment. Combined treatment with L-DOPA plus peripherally acting decarboxylase inhibitors resulted in a high incidence to psychoses in idiopathic Parkinsonism but the same dosis produced this side effect only in a few patients with cerebral atrophic dystrophy. The ratio was 5:1 between the former group and the later one. That means, that L-DOPA is a much more psychotoxic substance in Parkinsonism when compared to other cerebral diseases. These pharmacotoxic psychoses could be correlated with the progredience of the disease. These pharmacotoxic psychoses are not only dependent from age and duration of treatment. Evidence exist, that there might be a correlation between the incidence for pharmacotoxic psychoses and the lack of surviving dopaminergic neurons in the nigro-striatal areas. Treatment with very low doses of neuroleptics suppresses pharmacotoxic psychoses but allow a further anti-Parkinson therapy which is of vital necessity.",
      "Treatment of detrusor hyperreflexia in multiple sclerosis: a double-blind, crossover clinical trial comparing methantheline bromide (Banthine), flavoxate chloride (Urispas) and meladrazine tartrate (Lisidonil). 34 patients suffering from detrusor hyperreflexia due to multiple sclerosis entered the trial and 32 patients accomplished.

Registration of the number of micturitions was also made. Furthermore, the patients underwent cystometric studies. The following parameters were recorded and compared: residual urine, volume at the first bladder contraction, effective volume and amplitude of the first bladder contraction. The study showed that the patients preferred methantheline bromide. The entire cystometric pattern changed statistically significant with methantheline bromide, but only with concordance to the patients preferences in 60%. Decrease in number of micturitions and volume at the first bladder contraction were the only parameters showing accordance with the preferences. The drugs caused many various side effects. 12 treatment periods were discontinued due to side effects of meladrazine tartrate. The cystometric recordings seem to be of little use in evaluation of a drugs therapeutic effect, and it is difficult to find parameters which reflect the patients preference of the drugs.",
      "Perlapine and dopamine metabolism: prediction of antipsychotic efficacy. A model for the prediction of antipsychotic efficacy based on the dose-dependent increase in levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the striatum and tuberculum olfactorium of the rat is presented. The effect of perlapine, a sleep-promoting and sedative agent reported to lack antipsychotic efficacy, was compared in this system to haloperidol, chlorpromazine and clozapine. All four drugs produced a dose-dependent increase in DOPAC in the two dopamine-rich structures. The potency of perlapine was similar to that of chlorpromazine. Dopamine, assayed in the striatum and tuberculum olfactorium by a new gas chromatographic procedure was not altered by perlapine. The time--action curves for perlapine and clozapine were virtually identical both in the striatum and in the tuberculum olfactorium. All four drugs also elevated homovanillic acid to a similar extent. These results indicate that perlapine should be re-evaluated clinically. We predict that such trials will reveal that perlapine does possess antipsychotic efficacy."

      "In vivo and in vitro studies of nitrate reductase regulation in Asperillus nidulans. Induced wildtype cells of A. nidulans rapidly lost NADPH--linked nitrate reductase activity when subjected to carbon and or nitrogen starvation. A constitutive mutant at the regulatory gene for nitrate reductase, nir Ac 1, rapidly lost nitrate reductase activity upon carbon starvation. This loss of activity is thought to be due to a decrease in the NADPH concentration in the cells. Cell free extracts from wildtype cells grown in the presence of nitrate, rapidly lost their nitrate reductase activity when incubated at 25 degrees C. NADPH prevented this loss of activity. Wildtype cells grown in the presence of nitrate and urea have a higher initial NADPH:NADP+ ratio and cell free extracts from such cells lost their nitrate reductase activity slower than extracts of cells grown with nitrate alone. The Pentose Phosphate Pathway mutant, pppB-1, had a lower NADPH concentration compared with the wildtype grown under the same conditions and cell free extracts lost their nitrate reductase activity more rapidly than the wildtype. Cell free extracts of nirAc-1 and a non-inducible mutant for nitrate reductase, nirA- -14, upon incubation lost little of their nitrate reductase activity.",
      "Transcription of rat liver deoxyribonucleic acid in vitro at low ionic strength. 1. When RNA polymerase is in excess over DNA, the single-stranded breaks of DNA can be recognized as initiation sites for the ezyme. On the other hand stabel initiation complexes (resistant to inhibition by heparin) are the most abundant under these conditions. The formation of these complexes needs double-stranded DNA. It seems that RNA sequences rich in cytidine are preferentially synthesized; since rat liver DNA is A + T-rich, the transcription thus appears not to be random with respect to the base composition of DNA. 2. When the template is in excess over the polymerase, the single-stranded gaps of DNA are preferentially transcribed by rat liver RNA polymerase B and native DNA regions by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. 3. With a large excess of DNA over the polymerase, the enzyme activity is markedly inhibited. This inhibition is proportional to the concentration of double-stranded DNA ends, but it also depends on the presence of a contaminant of DNA, removed when DNA is banded in a CsCl gradient. This contaminant could be polyphosphates. Low concentrations of spermine completely reverse this inhibition, by enhancing the rate of RNA chain elongation. 4. Double-stranded RNA is synthesized in great abundance when RNA polymerase is in excess over native DNA. Besides a majority of symmetrical sequences, stable 'hairpins' can be found. Whereas the synthesis of symmetrical sequences is more prevalent in polymerase excess, it seems that the proportion of stable 'hairpins' in RNA is independent of the polymerase/DNA ratio."

The corneo-scleral changes described are highly characteristic and may be the first signs of an underlying systemic disorder so that otherwise healthy patients who present with limbal guttering and scleral disease must be continuously monitored with this association in mind. The clinical and histological features of limbal guttering in connective tissue disorders strongly suggest that a local antigen-antibody reaction triggers off a number of biochemical and cellular responses which combine to produce lysis of scleral and corneal collagen, although immune complexes have not so far been demonstrated in these eyes.
